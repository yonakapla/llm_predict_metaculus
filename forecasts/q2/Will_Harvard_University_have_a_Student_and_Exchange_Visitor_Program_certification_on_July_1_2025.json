Harvard is currently unable to sponsor new international students for the 2025\u201326 academic year except insofar as the TRO or a possible permanent injunction remains in place.

Alternatively, the administration could stall restoration on technicalities until after July 1. In all these instances, July 1 arrives with Harvard still lacking SEVP certification.",

This is most likely if the court finds the executive branch's actions to violate procedural or constitutional safeguards, which are likely but not guaranteed given the legal arguments. Alternatively, the administration could face enough legal or political pushback to relent and restore certification voluntarily or as part of a settlement, but this is less likely unless forced.",

In precedent (notably 2020), courts have blocked similar mass-impact actions by executive agencies, insisting on careful procedural safeguards and a high burden of justification, especially when harm to students is immediate. However, the current situation is uniquely escalated: the Trump administration is resolutely politicizing the issue, multiple grievances are entangled, and restoration hinges both on the speed of court orders and the technical/bureaucratic willingness of DHS to comply expeditiously. The window before July 1 is narrow. Restoration is dependent on the court quickly issuing a ruling in Harvard's favor, mandating immediate reinstatement, AND on DHS not dragging its feet. Given the TRO, the court's leanings, and the visible academic and public pressure, I assess a moderately high probability that SEVP certification is restored on or before July 1, but not overwhelming: there remains significant risk of bureaucratic or legal delay, and a nontrivial chance that the administration prevails, even temporarily, at the next hearing. Base rate for quick restorations after court injunctions is high, but not perfect. Weighing these dynamics, and attempting a bold, but justifiable posture, I assign a final probability of 68%.",

However, this is an unprecedented situation with a highly adversarial administration making SEVP eligibility contingent on controversial, possibly unlawful demands (including sweeping student records and political litmus tests). The legal system has so far acted swiftly to halt immediate harm, issuing TROs, with preliminary injunction hearings imminent. The major question is timeline: will the courts act decisively and fast enough to both grant relief and require DHS to restore active certification by July 1? While the long-term likelihood that Harvard re-gains SEVP is very high, the probability this happens operationally by the cutoff is meaningfully less, due to: 1) the highly politicized nature of the Trump administration\u2019s approach, 2) the strong incentive for delay tactics, 3) possible ambiguity about the effect of court orders (restoring prior state may not equate to active certification without administrative compliance), and 4) any possible compliance review or appeals by DHS or DOJ. Given the strength of Harvard\u2019s case, the direction of court responses so far, and the political stakes, I judge a moderate probability of restoration by July 1, but significant downside risk if court orders do not explicitly, expeditiously require certification to be in effect (as opposed to merely pausing the revocation). My judgment is that the probability of Harvard having active SEVP certification on July 1, 2025 is about 55%.",

Harvard's robust legal and reputational resources increase its resilience. The fact that multiple federal judges have already issued temporary restraining orders and explicitly criticized the sudden, punitive nature of the administration's move bodes well for Harvard. However, the administration's actions are extremely aggressive, timed for maximum disruption, and bolstered by plausible (if thin) arguments about national security and civil unrest, giving courts some pause about overriding executive discretion, especially at an interlocutory stage. The window until July 1 gives less than 5 weeks: unless a preliminary injunction is immediately granted and maintained (likely but not certain), or Harvard immediately complies with DHS demands (unlikely), the legal process could drag, risking a period where Harvard is technically uncertified per federal records even if it eventually wins the underlying case.

You talk about the 'vigorous ongoing litigation' and the likelihood of preliminary injunctions, but you skip over the critical operational question: does an injunction automatically put Harvard's SEVP certification 'in effect' in the DHS database, or simply stop further enforcement? Courts rarely micromanage agency databases, and DHS under Trump has shown itself willing to test or ignore ambiguous court orders on immigration issues. Plus, the risk of late-game legal maneuvers\u2014Supreme Court stays, administrative jiu-jitsu, bureaucratic molasses\u2014is very real with weeks, not months, on the clock.

Your callout that the window until July 1 is 'narrow' and that there\u2019s a 'nontrivial chance that the administration prevails even temporarily' is just the kind of concrete, operations-driven realism that a pure legal analysis glosses over.

The administration has both motive and means to slow-walk compliance regardless of the court\u2019s direction.

Those highlighting these timeline issues, technical hurdles, and the possibility of ambiguous court orders (that don't explicitly compel reinstatement in the system by July 1) are persuasive. I would marginally lower my probability to better reflect these non-trivial tail risks, even as courts remain very likely to side with Harvard on the merits.

While multiple participants believe injunctive relief is likely, there is significant consensus among the more nuanced voices that the highly adversarial, politicized nature of the episode injects substantial tail risk of technical non-compliance through July 1.

This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025\u20132026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.",

The decision, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was communicated through a memo and published by Politico. The move comes ahead of implementing a new screening protocol that will require the analysis of applicants' social media profiles. According to the document, consulates must 'immediately stop adding new slots for student and exchange visitor interviews until new guidance is issued.' Scheduled interviews can still proceed as planned. The new guidelines are expected to be released in the coming days. This initiative is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration to restrict the entry of foreign students, particularly those who express support for Palestinian causes or criticism of Israel. Rubio stated, 'If you apply for a visa to study in the United States and inform us that you plan to participate in movements that involve vandalism on campuses, harassment of students, occupation of buildings, riots -- we will not grant the visa.' In addition to suspending interviews, the Department of State is requiring diplomats to examine the social media profiles of student visa applicants and exchange visitors to identify posts deemed critical of the United States or Israel. Rubio claimed that over 300 visas have been revoked based on these analyses. Meanwhile, Harvard University is facing a series of sanctions from the federal government. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked the institution's certification to enroll international students, affecting around 6,800 foreign students. The measure was temporarily suspended by a court order, but the DHS stipulated that students must transfer to other institutions before the 2025-2026 academic year or risk losing their legal status. The Trump administration has also ordered the cancellation of federal contracts with Harvard, totaling approximately $100 million, and threatened to redirect up to $3 billion in funds to vocational schools. The actions are justified by allegations that the university harbors anti-Semitic activities and maintains ties with the Chinese Communist Party, claims that Harvard vehemently denies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 07:24 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/mundo/governo-trump-suspende-vistos-estudantis-e-impoe-vigilancia-ideologica-sobre-redes-sociais-de-aplicantes)\n\n**Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Revocation of Student Exchange Program**\nHarvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked the certification of the university's student and visitor exchange program. The move would put around 7,000 students at risk of losing their visa. According to the lawsuit, the DHS action is 'illegal and unjustified.' Harvard President Alan Garber stated, 'We condemn this action, which is a direct attack on our academic independence and the ability of our students to learn and grow in a safe and inclusive environment.' The university is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the revocation. The DHS had accused Harvard of allowing 'anti-American and pro-terrorist' foreigners to harass and physically attack people, and of hosting and training members of the Chinese Communist Party's paramilitary group. However, Harvard claims that it has complied with the requests for information, but that the responses were deemed insufficient. The university argues that the regulation does not provide a mechanism for the summary revocation of a school's certification after an out-of-cycle review. Harvard has also previously sued the Trump administration over the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funds, which it deemed illegal and unconstitutional.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 10:33 AM\nSource:[el-mexicano.com.mx](https://el-mexicano.com.mx/Noticia/The%20Border/78913/Harvard-se-va-contra-Trump-y-lo-demanda-por-suspenderle-la-admisi%C3%B3n-de-extranjeros)\n\n**US Department of Homeland Security Revokes Harvard's Certification for Student Exchange Program**\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused Harvard University of being 'antisemitic and pro-Chinese' and has revoked its certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

The decision comes after Harvard filed an emergency lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that the administration's actions were unconstitutional and motivated by revenge. Judge Allison Burroughs granted Harvard's request for a temporary injunction, stating that 'immediate harm would occur to Harvard before all sides can be heard.' The judge scheduled a hearing for May 29 to consider a longer-term block on the administration's actions. The ruling likely averts a crisis that could have affected current Harvard students, some of whom are set to graduate in the coming days. Harvard's lawsuit claims that the administration's actions were 'sudden and devastating' and would 'wipe out a quarter of Harvard's student body.' The university has approximately 6,700 international students, who make up about 27% of the student body. 'With one stroke of the pen, the government seeks to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body,' the lawsuit states. The Trump administration had previously frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding for Harvard after the university refused to comply with the White House's demands. Harvard then filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of conducting a 'lawless and unconstitutional campaign' to punish the university for defending its constitutional rights. The university has since expanded its lawsuit to include a $450 million grant cut, which the administration claims is necessary to prevent Harvard from certifying a student exchange program with China. The administration has also threatened to revoke the legal status of international students who do not transfer to another university. 'Harvard bears responsibility for cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party, encouraging violence, anti-Semitism, and terrorist behavior among students on its campus,' the administration claims. The Trump administration also alleges that Harvard's leadership has created a 'dangerous environment' that allows anti-American, terrorist agitators to harass and physically attack people, including many Jewish students.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: May 24, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[bastion.tv](https://bastion.tv/sud-ssha-zupiniv-sprobu-sionistiv-obmezhiti-pravo-garvarda-prijmati-inozemnih-studentiv_n71010)\n\n**Trump Administration Suspends Student Visa Interviews and Implements Social Media Screening**\nThe Trump administration has suspended new interviews for student visas (categories F, M, and J) at all US embassies and consulates, effective immediately.

Noem stated, 'It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments.' Harvard has filed a lawsuit to recover billions of dollars in frozen federal funding, and the university's administrators and students are concerned about the potential consequences of the DHS intervention.

White's decision changed the government's plan to change the legal status of international students until cases challenging previous visa revocations are resolved. He stated that the government's actions 'would not only affect the lives of the plaintiffs, but also similar F-1 non-immigrants in the United States and continue to do so.' The decision came after a DHS statement claiming that Harvard 'cannot enroll foreign students anymore, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.' DHS alleged that Harvard created an insecure campus by allowing 'anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators' on site and claimed, without evidence, that the university collaborated with the Communist Party of China. This latest escalation follows a House Select Committee investigation into Harvard's partnerships with organizations with alleged ties to the CPC. The escalation comes after a threat from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who threatened to revoke the 'privilege' of international students to enroll in the US unless the university provided records of the 'illegal and violent' activities of its students. Despite Harvard submitting an unspecified document to the Trump administration, Noem claimed that the university failed to comply with the law. 'Harvard had many opportunities to do the right thing. It refused,' she said in a statement. The increasing campaigns by the Trump administration against Harvard and international students are now intertwined. Last month, the Department of Justice initiated a surprising number of lawsuits to revoke student visas for minor legal infractions. The DOJ, however, stated that it would develop a new policy to change the F-1 visa to remove international students.

This move is seen as a crackdown on US universities that protested the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an escalation of the 'culture war' between American conservatives and liberals. According to CCTV News, US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Christine Nomm has issued a statement, immediately revoking Harvard University's eligibility to recruit international students. The university's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification has been terminated, meaning that Harvard will no longer be able to recruit new foreign students. This ban will take effect from the 2025-2026 academic year, marking the first time the US government has taken such severe visa sanctions against a single university. Nomm stated in the official statement that the revocation is due to Harvard's 'incitement of violence and anti-Semitism' and refusal to provide the US Department of Homeland Security with information about foreign students. The trigger for this move was the protests that broke out at multiple US universities, including Harvard, in support of Palestine during the 2024 Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The statement requires Harvard to provide records of foreign students, including any audio or video evidence of their involvement in protests over the past five years, within 72 hours in order to restore SEVP certification.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 01:17 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250527/48386951.html)\n\n**Trump Accuses Harvard of Delaying Information on Foreign Students, Threatens to Withdraw Subsidies**\nUS President Donald Trump has accused Harvard University of being slow in providing information about foreign students and promoting 'anti-American' policies. Trump threatened to withdraw $3 billion in federal subsidies from the institution and redirect those funds to vocational schools across the country. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, 'We are still waiting for Harvard's lists of foreign students to determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of billions of dollars, how many radicalized individuals should not be readmitted to our country.' Trump also called Harvard 'very anti-Semitic' and reiterated his intention to withdraw federal funds from the institution: 'I am considering withdrawing three billion dollars in subsidies from a very anti-Semitic Harvard and giving them to vocational schools across our country. What a great investment that would be for the United States, and so necessary!' The controversy escalated after Judge Allison D. Burroughs, appointed by former President Barack Obama, granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Harvard, preventing the government from revoking the university's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. According to a letter sent by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Harvard had lost the 'privilege' of admitting foreign students due to its refusal to comply with repeated requests for information. Noem accuses the university of fostering a hostile environment towards Jewish students, promoting pro-Hamas sympathies, and applying policies she calls 'racist' under the diversity, equity, and inclusion approach. Harvard responded to the request in two instances, but the authorities considered the documentation insufficient. The university has filed a lawsuit against the Department, arguing that the revocation of its certification would affect over 7,000 international students, representing more than a quarter of its total enrollment. Harvard considers the measure a violation of the First Amendment, due process, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 06:46 PM\nSource:[Exc\u00e9lsior](https://www.excelsior.com.mx/global/trump-acusa-a-harvard-de-retrasar-la-entrega-de-informacion-sobre-estudiantes-extranjeros)\n\n**Trump Warns of Revoking Harvard's $3 Billion Funding, Transferring to Vocational Schools**\nUS President Trump has strongly criticized Harvard University for its handling of anti-Semitism, foreign student screening, and financial management issues. He is considering diverting the $3 billion in federal funding originally allocated to Harvard to vocational schools across the country. Trump wrote on his social media platform 'Truth Social': 'I am considering withdrawing $3 billion in funding from Harvard University, which has a strong anti-Semitic tendency, and transferring it to vocational schools across the country. This would be a great investment for the US and is absolutely necessary!!!' Trump questioned why Harvard does not disclose that about 31% of its students are foreign nationals, and why these countries do not pay for their education, but instead, American taxpayers do. He also criticized Harvard for not submitting a complete list of foreign students in a timely manner, which he claims is necessary to identify potential radical elements and prevent them from returning to the US. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has revoked Harvard's student and exchange visitor program (SEVP) certification, which means the university cannot accept new foreign students and existing students must decide whether to transfer or leave the country. DHS also accused Harvard of failing to comply with student record submission requirements and of having ties with the Chinese Communist Party, which allegedly enables violent, anti-Semitic, and pro-terrorist activities. Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the government, claiming that the Trump administration's actions violate the First Amendment and will have a devastating impact on the university and over 7,000 visa holders. A temporary restraining order was issued by a federal judge, Allison Burroughs, to halt the government's order. A hearing to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction is scheduled for May 27. In addition to revoking Harvard's eligibility to accept new students, the Trump administration has also frozen millions of dollars in federal research funding for the university, citing its failure to submit a complete list of international students, which has hindered security reviews. The White House has also launched a tax audit of Harvard's donation fund and warned that it may revoke the university's tax-exempt status. Harvard's 2024 financial report shows that its operating income reached $6.5 billion, but its operating profit has plummeted to $45 million. The Trump administration has not specified which funds will be reallocated. Trump said in response to Harvard's lawsuit: 'Harvard University's greatest advantage is that they have found the best judge for themselves, but don't worry, the government will win!' He emphasized that this is not only a reform for Harvard, but also for the entire US education system. He added: 'We want to know who these foreign students are, which is a reasonable request, because we gave Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard is not being transparent.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd](https://www.secretchina.com/news/gb/2025/05/27/1082862.html)\n\n**Harvard University Loses Student and Exchange Visitor Program Certification for Pro-Terrorist Conduct HS Today**\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has terminated Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification due to concerns about campus safety and compliance with federal requirements.

This decision not only affects the fate of thousands of international students but also marks the escalation of the long-standing conflict between the Trump administration and top US universities. Harvard University quickly responded, calling the move 'unlawful' and vowing to fight it to the end. This conflict reflects the intense schism in American society between political polarization, educational autonomy, and national security. According to the statement, Harvard University's student and exchange visitor program certification was immediately revoked, meaning that from the 2025-2026 academic year, Harvard would not be able to recruit any foreign students holding F-class or J-class visas. Existing international students must transfer to other certified institutions before their identity expires, or they will face the risk of deportation. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Christine Norn accused Harvard of tolerating campus violence and anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. She also threatened to extend this measure to other universities. However, Harvard University responded firmly, stating that the government's actions were unlawful and harmful, and emphasizing the irreplaceable contributions of international students to academia and society. The university has launched a legal procedure, accusing the government of abusing administrative power to interfere with academic freedom. This sanction is not an isolated event, but rather the result of the long-standing game between the Trump administration and Harvard. Since January 2025, the US government has forced Harvard to compromise through measures such as freezing federal funding, terminating project funding, and even forcing the president to take a pay cut. The Trump administration has also demanded that Harvard abolish its diversity policies, reform its admissions system, and accused it of tolerating anti-Semitism. Harvard has refused, citing academic independence and stating that these demands harm its core values.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 24, 2025 08:05 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250524/48377371.html)\n\n**Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Attempt to Revok Harvard's Ability to Admit International Students**\nA federal judge in Boston has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Harvard University's ability to admit international students. The university had filed a lawsuit arguing that the order was an unconstitutional retaliation for resisting political pressure from the White House. According to Harvard, the government tried to eliminate a quarter of its student population, affecting international students in particular. The university's president, Alan Garber, called the government's action 'illegal and unjustified', putting the future of thousands of students and academics at risk. The judge, Allison Burroughs, granted a temporary restraining order, freezing the Trump administration's measure. The Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, had signed the order revoking Harvard's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effective for the 2025-2026 academic year. Harvard was accused of 'promoting violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party'. The move sparked international reactions, with the German Minister of Research, Dorothee B\u00e4r, expressing concern and lamenting the US decision, calling it 'very bad'. The Chinese government warned that this policy would harm the international image of the United States. According to Harvard, in 2024, the university had 6,703 international students, with 1,203 from China, the largest foreign group.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[La Naci\u00f3n, Grupo Naci\u00f3n](https://www.nacion.com/el-mundo/jueza-bloquea-medida-de-trump-que-impedia-a/6CEMPIALAVBLHLOA43YDMPQAVU/story/)\n\n**Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Revocation of International Student Certification**\nHarvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for revoking its certification to accept international students, citing a 'flagrant violation of the First Amendment' and a 'reprisal against Harvard' for rejecting 'its demands to control the institution, its curriculum, and the ideology of professors and students.' The university argues that the administration's actions are 'illegal', disregard government regulations, and lack 'rational explanation.' Harvard asserts that the certification is 'essential' for international students to remain legally in the country while completing their courses, and the revocation has 'disrupted numerous academic programs, research laboratories, and clinics.' The university also claims to have complied with the administration's requirements in April to maintain its funding and provided information on student visa holders to the government. President Alan Garber wrote, 'For the students and international academics affected by yesterday's action, they know they are vital members of our community. They are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors.' Harvard previously sued the administration in April to recover its frozen federal funding (2.6 billion dollars) due to alleged antisemitic conduct. The administration has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding and launched multiple investigations into the university, accusing it of promoting 'discriminatory positive policies' and not allowing 'diversity of ideas.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has eliminated the student visa program at Harvard, revoking its certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. As a result, Harvard can no longer enroll international students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the decision is due to 'pro-terrorist conduct' in student protests on campus and Harvard's refusal to comply with DHS requests for student behavior records. Noem accused the university of promoting violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on campus. She offered Harvard a 72-hour deadline to provide the requested information, with the opportunity to recover its visa program for the next academic year. The university has demanded the government in response to the threat of withdrawing billions of dollars in federal funding and has strongly opposed the various investigations, denying the allegations of irregularities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 04:02 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/5/23/harvard-demanda-nuevamente-trump-por-acciones-ilegales-537392.html)\n\n**Harvard's International Students Face Uncertainty as Trump Administration Revokes SEVP Certification**\nUS Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on May 22 that Harvard University's 'Student and Exchange Visitor Program' (SEVP) certification would be revoked, effective for the 2025-2026 academic year. Noem accused Harvard of 'promoting violence, anti-Semitism, and cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party.' Harvard's current international students will be forced to transfer, change their visa, or leave the country, or risk losing their legal status in the US. According to Harvard's data, there are approximately 6,800 international students at Harvard, making up 27% of the student body. Harvard later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking a temporary injunction, claiming that the government's decision is unconstitutional and will have a devastating impact on students and scholars. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, a Harvard alumnus with a Master's degree in public health, has expressed concern about the potential impact on the long-term cooperation between Taiwan and Harvard's Kennedy School. Noem stated that she would consider taking similar measures against other universities, saying, 'This should serve as a warning to all universities to be on high alert.' Trump has been targeting American universities with 'anti-Semitism' and 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, using reduced federal funding as leverage to force universities to comply. MIT and Columbia University, both facing recruitment and layoff challenges, have been targeted by Trump. MIT has announced plans to reduce its research-based master's program by 100 students, an 8% decrease, and will also cut 10% of its administrative staff, although the exact number of layoffs is unknown. Columbia University, a major target of Trump's attacks, has seen a significant decrease in applications, with AtomicMind, a study abroad organization, reporting a sharp decline in applications to Columbia.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 03:47 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250523004765-260408)\n\n**Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Restrictions on International Students**\nHarvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security, under the direction of Kristi Noem, revoked its authorization to enroll international students, a move that puts the academic future of thousands of students at risk. The conflict arose after Harvard rejected the federal government's demands to subject its admissions and hiring processes to external oversight. Trump criticized the institution, accusing it of promoting anti-Semitism and a progressive ideology. In retaliation, his administration took drastic measures: threatening to review the $9.1 billion in federal funds allocated to Harvard, freezing a first installment of $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in public contracts, and even deporting a researcher from its Medical School. In the lawsuit, presented to a federal court in Massachusetts, the university denounces this action as 'the latest act of the government in clear retaliation for Harvard's exercise of its rights, protected by the First Amendment, in rejecting the government's demands to control its governance, curriculum, and 'ideology' of its faculty and students.' The measure will severely affect the institution, where more than a quarter of the student body is international and pays tuition that exceeds tens of thousands of dollars annually. The veto materialized with the revocation of Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), essential for international students to study in the US with F or J visas. This will prevent the university from admitting new international students for the 2025-2026 cycle. Although a federal judge ordered the temporary suspension nationwide of any revocation of immigration status for international students, it is still unclear if this measure will protect enrolled students at Harvard. Alan Garber, Harvard's president, described the government's decision as an 'illegal and unjustified' action that 'puts the future of thousands of Harvard students and academics at risk, as well as serving as a warning to those in other universities who came to the US to fulfill their dreams.' Garber confirmed that the institution will file a request for a temporary restraining order to block the measure. Noem justified the decision by stating that the government 'holds Harvard accountable for promoting violence, anti-Semitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.' Chinese students, who represent more than 20% of Harvard's international student body, are particularly affected. The Chinese government reacted, stating that the measure 'only damages the image and international position of the United States.' Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated that China 'opposes the politicization of educational cooperation.' Meanwhile, some students, such as Karl Molden, a 21-year-old Austrian studying classical literature, are already seeking alternatives. Molden, who described his admission to Harvard as the 'greatest privilege' of his life, requested his transfer to the University of Oxford due to fear of US immigration policies. The Harvard University Faculty Association condemned the government's decision as 'the latest in a series of openly authoritarian and retaliatory measures against the country's oldest institution of higher education.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[102.5 FM, Radio Universidad de Chile](https://radio.uchile.cl/2025/05/23/harvard-enfrenta-al-gobierno-de-trump-por-restricciones-a-estudiantes-internacionales/)\n\n**How Donald Trump's Crackdown On Harvard Will Affect Indian Students**\nThe Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's authority to enroll international students under the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), affecting nearly 6,800 students, including 788 from India. The decision, citing Harvard's failure to comply with US government requests for information, requires students to transfer to another SEVP-certified institution to remain legally in the US. Many Indian students are enrolled in long-term doctoral or multi-year graduate programmes, and transferring mid-course could be academically disruptive. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem criticized Harvard's diversity, equity and inclusion policies, calling them 'racist' and 'hostile to Jewish students.' 'This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,' Noem wrote on X. The administration has given Harvard 72 hours to produce the requested documents and meet other demands if it hopes to restore its SEVP status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 03:56 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harvard-university-indian-students-how-donald-trumps-crackdown-on-harvard-will-affect-indian-students-8485243)\n\n**Trump Admin Blocks Harvard\u2019s Foreign Admissions Over Antisemitism, China Allegations**\nThe Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), suspending its ability to enroll new international students and barring it from hosting any foreign students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Existing international students must now transfer to another institution to maintain their visa status. US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision, stating that Harvard is being held accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus. Noem wrote, 'It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused. They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law.' This move follows an earlier warning in April and is part of a broader federal crackdown on US universities aimed at addressing antisemitism and reducing diversity programs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 12:12 AM\nSource:[news18.com](https://www.news18.com/world/trump-administration-blocks-harvard-from-enrolling-new-international-students-report-9348680.html)\n\n**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Student Visa Program**\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced the elimination of the student visa program at Harvard University due to the institution's 'pro-terrorist conduct' during campus protests. According to a report by Fox News Digital, the DHS will eliminate the program as a result of Harvard's refusal to comply with requests for student conduct records, as well as its lack of effort to combat antisemitism on campus. 'This administration holds Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,' said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. 'It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to admit foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to increase their multimillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had many opportunities to do the right thing. They refused. They have lost their certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program for not complying with the law. Let this be a warning to all universities and academic institutions in the country.' Harvard may also stop accepting foreign students for the 2025-2026 academic year, and current foreign students must transfer or risk losing their legal status to remain in the US before the start of the next academic year. 'As a result of your blatant refusal to comply with multiple requests for relevant information from the Department of Homeland Security, while perpetuating an unsafe and hostile university environment for Jewish students, promoting pro-Hamas rhetoric, and employing racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege,' Noem wrote in a letter to Maureen Martin, director of immigration services at the university. Noem offered Harvard 72 hours to provide the requested information and regain its visa program for the next academic year. She added that the measure is 'a direct result of Harvard's tremendous failure to meet the most basic information requirements.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 11:28 PM\nSource:[One America News Network](https://www.oann.com/noticias-latinas/el-gobierno-de-trump-prohibe-a-harvard-inscribir-a-estudiantes-extranjeros/)\n\n**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Certification Over 'Pro-Terrorist Behavior'**\nThe Trump Administration announced on May 22, 2025, that it is revoking the certification of Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) due to 'pro-terrorist behavior' on campus. According to Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, Harvard has 'perpetuated an unsafe environment' that is 'hostile to Jewish students, promotes support for Hamas, and applies racist diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.' The measure, which affects international students, was taken in response to protests on campus against the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Noem stated that Harvard failed to provide information on its activities over the past few years. The university has 72 hours to provide the required information to recover its certification. If not, it will not be able to enroll international students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Noem warned that providing false information could result in penalties or civil sanctions. She also accused Harvard of 'fostering violence and antisemitism' on campus and of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. 'Admitting international students is a privilege, not a right,' Noem said, highlighting that universities benefit from increased international enrollment. The decision is part of the tensions between the Trump Administration and universities over pro-Palestinian protests. Noem emphasized that the measure is a warning to all academic institutions in the country to comply with federal requirements.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 08:50 PM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https://www.eldiario.ec/la-administracion-trump-prohibe-a-la-universidad-de-harvard-matricular-a-estudiantes-extranjeros-20250522/)\n\n**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Ability to Enroll International Students**\nThe Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, escalating its battle with the prestigious institution. The move, announced by the Department of Homeland Security, requires thousands of current international students to transfer to other schools or leave the country. According to the agency, Harvard created a 'hostile campus environment' by allowing 'anti-American agitators and pro-terrorists' to attack Jewish students. The administration also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, claiming that it had harbored and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. As supposed evidence of this, a link to a Fox News article was provided, citing a letter from Republican lawmakers. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that 'this administration is holding Harvard accountable for promoting violence, anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.' The action involved the revocation of Harvard's certification in the Exchange Visitor Program, which stripped the school of its ability to sponsor visas for international students. Harvard inscribes nearly 6,800 international students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, representing more than a quarter of its student body. The university has called the action 'illegal' and is working to provide guidance to students. In a statement, Harvard said that 'this retaliatory action threatens to cause severe harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.' The dispute originated from a request by Secretary Noem on April 16, who demanded that Harvard provide information on foreign students who may be involved in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. In a recent letter to Harvard, Noem indicated that the sanction is 'the unfortunate result of Harvard's failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.' The sanction prohibits Harvard from hosting international students for the 2025-26 academic year, but added that the university can regain this ability if it provides a list of international students within 72 hours. The administration's latest request demands all records, including audio or video recordings, of international students participating in protests or dangerous activities on campus. This sanction opens a new front in the Trump administration's battle with Harvard. The university, the oldest and richest in the country, was the first to openly challenge the White House's demands to limit Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. The federal government had previously cut $2.6 billion in federal funding to Harvard, forcing it to self-finance much of its vast research operation. President Donald Trump expressed his desire to strip the university of its tax-exempt status. Many of the punishments against Harvard come from a federal working group on anti-Semitism that argues that the university did not protect Jewish students from harassment and violence amidst a national wave of Palestinian protests. Homeland Security officials echoed these concerns, citing a recent internal report at Harvard that found that many Jewish students reported facing discrimination or prejudice on campus. The Trump administration used the system designed to track the legal status of international students as part of its broader efforts to take tough action against higher education. What was once an administrative database became a policing tool, with immigration officials revoking student status directly in the system. These efforts were challenged in court, resulting in the restoration of status and a national court order blocking the administration from pursuing further terminations. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, called the latest action 'an egregious and petty abuse of power' and expressed concern that it would send a 'very discouraging effect' to international students seeking to study in the United States.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[La Voz](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/mundo/donald-trump-le-impidio-a-la-universidad-de-harvard-la-posibilidad-de-inscribir-estudiantes-extranjeros/)\n\n**Trump Admin Tries to Expel Harvard's Foreign Students**\nThe Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by revoking its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows the university to enroll international students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the move, citing Harvard's refusal to provide information on 'criminality and misconduct of foreign students' and claims of a 'toxic campus climate' due to handling of antisemitism. Noem stated, 'This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.' Harvard has rebuked the action, calling it 'unlawful' and threatening 'serious harm to the Harvard community and our country.' The university has been at odds with the Trump administration over compliance with its demands, including reforms to admissions and hiring practices, elimination of diversity initiatives, and auditing of departments. Harvard has pushed back against these demands and is currently suing the government over a frozen $2.2 billion in federal grants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:55 PM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-admin-bars-harvard-from-enrolling-foreign-students.html)\n\n**Trump administration prohibits Harvard from admitting international students**\nThe Trump administration has taken a significant step in its campaign to pressure Harvard University by prohibiting the admission of international students. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has eliminated the student visa program at the university, revoking Harvard's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As a result, Harvard will no longer be able to enroll international students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Current international students must transfer to another university or risk losing their legal status to reside in the US. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the decision is due to 'pro-terrorist conduct' in student protests on campus, as well as Harvard's refusal to comply with DHS requests for student behavior records. Noem accused the university of promoting violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on campus. She also claimed that Harvard perpetuates a hostile and insecure environment for Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas rhetoric, and employs 'racist' diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. Harvard has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration, with at least eight investigations involving six federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs. The administration has also withdrawn or frozen nearly $4 billion in funding to Harvard and its research partners. Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, although the legality of this move is uncertain.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:47 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/5/22/trump-prohibe-harvard-aceptar-estudiantes-extranjeros-537392.html)\n\n**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Certification for International Students**\nUS Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday that the Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's certification for the 'Student and Exchange Visitor Program' (SEVP), which will affect up to 6,793 international students who may face immediate deportation or transfer. This is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's recent actions against elite universities. Noem sent a formal letter to Harvard's Director of Immigration Services, Maureen Martin, accusing the university of 'tolerating violence, anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party,' and claiming that the campus environment 'poses a serious safety risk.' She stated, 'Receiving foreign students is a privilege, not a right. These students' high tuition fees should not be used to enrich Harvard's $50 billion foundation. Harvard had the opportunity to do the right thing, but it chose not to. This will serve as a warning to all American universities.' The SEVP originally allowed Harvard to accept nearly 6,800 international students for the 2024-2025 academic year. The news has sparked widespread concern and shock in the academic community. In fact, Noem had already suspended $2.7 million in federal research funding for Harvard last month and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. This latest move is seen as a clear escalation in the Trump administration's ongoing battle with traditional liberal arts universities.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:20 PM\nSource:[std.stheadline.com](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/2070318/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B-%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%AE%A3%E5%B8%83%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%93%88%E4%BD%9B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E6%8B%9B%E6%94%B6%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E7%94%9F%E8%B3%87%E6%A0%BC-%E6%96%99%E6%95%B8%E5%8D%83%E7%8F%BE%E6%9C%89%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F%E9%A0%88%E8%BD%89%E6%A0%A1)\n\n**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Certification, Banning International Students**\nThe Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), effectively banning the university from admitting international students. The move, announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, will also put the legal status of the approximately 8,600 international students currently enrolled at Harvard at risk. According to the Department of Homeland Security, students who do not transfer to another university or leave the country voluntarily will be subject to forced expulsion and may face difficulties in the future if they wish to return to the US. The DHS has accused Harvard's leadership of creating a 'perilous' university environment by allowing 'anti-American agitators and pro-terrorist sympathizers' to harass and physically attack students, including many Jewish students, and of collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. Harvard has been a target of the White House since April, when President Trump accused the university of being 'extremely left-wing' and of antisemitism after protests in support of Palestine on campus. When Harvard refused to modify its programs and admissions policies to appease the President, Trump cut off federal funding to the university. Harvard has since announced that it will use its own funds, totaling $250 million, to continue its research activities.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 06:33 PM\nSource:[Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/05/22/amministrazione-trump-revoca-certificazione-studenti-stranieri-harvard-news/7999017/)\n\n**Harvard Faces Threat of Losing International Student Certification**\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has formally notified Harvard University that it may lose its certification to enroll international students if it does not comply with a request to provide detailed information about alleged 'illegal and violent activities' committed by foreign students during recent protests on campus. The university has been asked to submit a report by April 30, and if it fails to comply, the government threatens to revoke its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which would effectively prevent Harvard from issuing essential documents for international students' visas. Currently, 27.2% of Harvard's students are international, totaling 6,793 students, according to data from the 2024-2025 academic year. The move is part of a broader escalation by the Trump administration against institutions of higher education accused of promoting a 'hostile' environment for Jewish students. The DHS has also announced the cancellation of two federal grants worth $2.7 million. The letter sent by Noem accuses Harvard of negligence in the face of anti-Semitic acts and demands information about students with visas who allegedly threatened classmates, disrupted the academic environment, or participated in violent protests. According to The Harvard Crimson, the measure is based on the assessment that 'attending Harvard is a privilege, not a guaranteed right.' Harvard responded that it will not give up its institutional independence or constitutional rights. 'We will continue to comply with the law and hope that the Administration will do the same,' says a excerpt from the official note, which also reiterates the demand that any eventual sanction follow legal procedures. The action occurs in the midst of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to reconfigure university policies in the US. Besides Harvard, other institutions have been pressured to eliminate diversity programs, ban the use of masks in protests, and adopt more restrictive admission criteria based solely on academic merit.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mundo/trump-sobe-o-tom-contra-harvard-e-ameaca-impedir-matricula-de-estudantes-estrangeiros/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a range of expert perspectives\u2014including university administration, immigration law, higher education studies, and public policy\u2014there is broad but not absolute consensus that Harvard is likely to have its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification in effect on July 1, 2025. All experts highlight that Harvard's certification was revoked by the Trump administration in May 2025 but that this revocation is currently blocked by a federal court\u2019s temporary restraining order (TRO), with further hearings imminent regarding a longer-term injunction. \n\nKey factors considered by forecasters include:  \n- Strong legal precedent for courts intervening to prevent abrupt decertification of major universities, especially when due process and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) are in question; \n- The aggressiveness and political motivation of the Trump administration, decreasing the probability of voluntary reinstatement but increasing the likelihood of ongoing courtroom conflict and potential delays; \n- The high base rate for judicial relief and restoration in similar university/federal government disputes, particularly when thousands of students are affected and reputational and economic costs are high; \n- The risk that, even if the courts ultimately favor Harvard, bureaucratic or administrative delays (and possible continued government resistance) might prevent certification from being actively in force on the exact cutoff date; \n- Harvard's significant resources, legal capacity, and broad-based political and institutional support, which all increase odds of an expedited legal or administrative remedy; \n- The extraordinarily short timeframe (just over a month) for complete legal or administrative resolution, making timeline management critical.\n\nScenarios resulting in a 'Yes' outcome generally involve a federal court granting and maintaining a preliminary injunction that requires immediate restoration of Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification\u2014a scenario considered very plausible by all experts. 'No' outcomes hinge on unfavorably slow legal processes, court unwillingness to grant stronger relief, administrative resistance, or the Trump administration prevailing in court (all seen as possible but less likely).\n\nProbability estimates from experts range from 55% to 88%, with most clustered between the higher 60s and low 80s. The modal judgment is moderately high but stops short of certainty due to unusual political aggression and potential tactical delay from the executive branch. Current legal momentum, judicial skepticism of the administration\u2019s approach, and past precedent heavily favor at least temporary restoration, but experts repeatedly note nontrivial risk of technical or procedural complications derailing a timely outcome.\n\nIn summary: The expert consensus is that, barring an unprecedented judicial or administrative break with recent legal tradition, Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification is more likely than not to be in effect on July 1, 2025. Nevertheless, significant uncertainty remains due to the Trump administration\u2019s tenacity, the condensed timeline, and achievable-but-not-guaranteed court-driven remedies."
