There is no evidence over the last three weeks that this threat has diminished or that diplomatic negotiations have reached a point where Benin\u2019s government would feel secure enough to reopen\u2014especially before the one-month mark has elapsed. The precedent for border closures in response to terrorist threats in West Africa is that they are usually prolonged, sometimes lasting several months, until authorities are confident the immediate threat has been neutralized or at least substantially mitigated. Furthermore, regional instability is increasing, not decreasing, per multiple credible sources (including US AFRICOM). On the other hand, the fact that border reopenings elsewhere can be abrupt with changing security conditions keeps the probability above single digits. The most compelling base rate is that closures for security in the Sahel region generally persist beyond a few weeks, especially when the predicate threat remains active and political/diplomatic tensions have not subsided.

West African precedent shows such closures, particularly when justified as terrorism countermeasures, are resistant to rapid reversal and often require substantial technical consultation (weeks at minimum, often several months). The closure is less than a month old with no public evidence of progress in bilateral negotiation or de-escalation of the security threat. While commercial and ECOWAS trade pressures exist, they are unlikely to outweigh security priorities in the short time window to July 1. Recent US AFRICOM warnings add to the sense of regional insecurity. No news indicates a bilateral diplomatic initiative to expedite reopening, nor is there evidence of threat abatement. Overall, the base rate for re-opening within 7 weeks of closure due to active militant threat in this part of West Africa is low, unless there is a dramatic and well-publicized breakthrough. Thus, my best estimate is that the probability Benin re-opens its closed land border crossings with Nigeria\u2019s Kwara state before July 1, 2025 is very low.",

While there is some trade/economic and diplomatic pressure, similar past closures in the region have frequently persisted due to entrenched security concerns, even in the face of economic hardship or partial alleviation (river crossings, bush paths). Moreover, no recent reporting indicates that Benin is proactively preparing to roll back border controls near Kwara, unlike Venezuela\u2019s prompt border reopening after elections. Thus, unless there is a rapid, positive shift in the security situation which seems highly unlikely within just one month, the probability of full and credibly reported reopening before July 1, 2025, remains low.

The window until July 1 is short (about one month); current reporting suggests no meaningful decrease in the security threat (in fact, US AFRICOM and multiple outlets report terror threat is rising), and both governments are signaling caution. While some rumors and opposition voices suggest the closure is also political or influenced by France, the primary drivers appear to be security.

Given these facts, a reopening would require either a rapid and credible improvement in the regional security situation or a serious economic/diplomatic cost for Benin that outweighs the risk \u2014 neither of which is visible so far.

There is no current indication that Benin perceives the threat as diminished; if anything, regional rhetoric suggests mounting anxiety and an aggressive anti-infiltration posture, informed by the broader deterioration in Sahel security. At the same time, closures for security are not always very long if the acute catalyst (a specific group, smuggling ring, etc.) is neutralized or contained, or if robust security cooperation is arranged. Given historical regional practice, there is a plausible path for at least partial reopening within 4-8 weeks if negotiations progress and security incidents subside\u2014but no concrete evidence yet that this is happening. Thus, before July 1 (about 1 month from now), the balance slightly favors continued closure, especially because recent public communications emphasize the gravity, not the resolution, of the threat.

However, closures prompted by acute security threats (especially with active insurgencies or credible spillovers from Sahelian jihadist groups) often persist for months\u2014sometimes until a clear change in threat context or major diplomatic intervention. \n\nThe Mahmuda terror group has triggered a spike in regional concern (including at the US AFRICOM strategic level), and the general environment is worsening: Jihadist activity is rising in adjacent regions, and both the local and global narrative is of a growing, not receding, threat. There is little evidence (as of end May 2025) that the Mahmuda situation is resolved or that Benin's security services have revised their risk calculus. Previous Benin closures (like the land border with Niger) proved stubborn even in the face of major economic discomfort, reopening only partially after diplomatic signals shifted and some security conditions improved\u2014and even then, with caveats.\n\nA compelling case for an imminent reopening would require signs of either: (1) a local security improvement (Mahmuda 'neutralized'), (2) a diplomatic breakthrough (announced bilateral deal or ECOWAS mediation success), or (3) clear public Beninese signals that economic/trade interests now trump security concerns. None of these appear present. Trade and community lobbying is ongoing, but does not yet seem decisive. The closure is also only a few weeks old; the typical duration for security-motivated border closures in the region is longer, especially when regional security is deteriorating and Benin faces international pressure to remain vigilant.\n\nSummarizing: A reopening before July 1, 2025, is possible but improbable without a substantial, credible catalyst. The weight of precedent, ongoing threat perception, and current diplomatic inertia leads me to a baseline probability in the 15-25% range, slightly on the optimistic side given ECOWAS/West African quick-enough diplomacy and cross-border economic pain, but mainly constrained by security factors.",

You're also absolutely right that symbolic, limited humanitarian corridors do not constitute reopening under this question's bar.

No. And public sector risk aversion, under international scrutiny and regional instability, only further cements your low probability. If anything, you\u2019re generous at 10%.

You resist the temptation, common among IR theorists and diplomatic idealists, to inflate odds based on desperate scenarios of sudden negotiations or trade-driven reversals. Instead, you steadily hammer home the core fact: as long as the Mahmuda group is a live threat, and as long as Sahel insecurity is spiking, no reasonable policymaker in Cotonou is going to rush a high-profile reopening for the sake of local traders. You refuse to buy hope over evidence. This is grounded, pragmatic forecasting\u2014no wishcasting, just a cold read of the ground truth. More should follow your lead."

Instead, the dominant variables\u2014persistent insecurity, absence of bilateral or ECOWAS breakthroughs, and a recent closure\u2014continue to point toward protracted restriction.

No credible signals of negotiation traction, mediation, or threat abatement have appeared. The critiques highlight that optimistic scenarios are not supported by regional practice or current reporting, and even the possibility of a partial or symbolic reopening is unlikely to be both substantial and credibly reported before July 1.

Arguments in favor of a higher probability (e.g., 35%) were widely critiqued for unrealistic optimism, lack of empirical grounding, and the absence of any signals of imminent threat resolution or diplomatic breakthrough. The mood across the board is even more skeptical than my already-low 20% estimate, with persuasive statistical and operational reasoning supporting figures in the 7-15% range. No new intelligence or even rumors of diplomatic movement, operational confidence, or threat neutralization have emerged. Given the overwhelming analytical alignment and absence of new developments, I am compelled to adjust my probability downward to reflect not only the base rates but the absence of concrete catalysts that would justify optimism for reopening before July 1.

No one provides credible evidence of negotiations or security progress, and consensus reaffirms that base rates for comparable security-led border closures *under active threat* are low, often below my initial estimate. The only factor warranting a minimally higher probability would be a possible surprise policy reversal, but the lack of precedent for such rapid reopening under worsening conditions outweighs this. Therefore, I maintain my initial low probability, finding no justification for an upward revision. If anything, the group would push toward being more pessimistic.

'It's in the Sahel where we consider the epicenter of terrorism. Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger are facing this daily', Langley said in a virtual press conference held in Nairobi. The three countries are led by military juntas that took power in recent years, partly due to the population's frustration with recurring jihadist attacks. 'Terrorist networks affiliated with ISIS and Al Qaeda are thriving, especially in Burkina Faso, where the government has lost control of vast areas of its sovereign territory', Langley emphasized. Since the US withdrew its troops from Niger in September 2024, Langley has observed 'an increase in attacks by these extremist organizations' not only in that country but 'across the entire Sahel, including Nigeria'. 'These increases -he explained- can be measured by both frequency and complexity of these attacks, driven by persistent socio-economic grievances and the proliferation of arms, and the increase of terrorist groups capable in all areas'. Langley admitted that 'with our withdrawal from the region, we have lost our ability to closely monitor these terrorist groups, but we continue to be in contact with our partners to provide the support we can'. He also noted that 'the magnitude and brutality of some of these incidents are really alarming'. The attacks are 'resurging' in the Lake Chad region, and the jihadist groups are becoming 'more aggressive'. One of the new objectives of the terrorists is to access the coast of West Africa, Langley pointed out. 'If they manage to access the coast -he continued-, they can finance operations of smuggling, human trafficking, and arms trafficking. This not only puts African nations at risk, but also increases the possibility of threats reaching US coastlines'. Therefore, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Benin (all countries in the Gulf of Guinea) 'are fiercely fighting along their northern borders to prevent terrorist expansion', Langley asserted. 'We expect soon the nomination of my successor. But regardless of who occupies this position, the AFRICOM mission remains unchanged.

According to reports by journalist Jonathan Maldonado of La Naci\u00f3n, the barriers at the San Antonio customs entrance were removed before 6:00 am. The movement began immediately, as dozens of pedestrians, motorcyclists, and vehicles waited to cross into Colombia. Many citizens travel daily to C\u00facuta or La Parada, some for work, others for study, and others for medical procedures or migration. The previous closure left many people unable to cross the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge. The border closure, which started at midnight on Friday and lasted until Tuesday morning, caught many citizens by surprise, who were waiting to cross with their luggage, unaware that the border was closed. The government applied the measure for security reasons and informed that the goal was to preserve the inviolability of the borders and prevent activities that could represent threats during the electoral process. It is worth noting that during the temporary closure, a humanitarian channel was opened, which attended to people with health emergencies or special situations. More than 1,000 citizens were assisted during those 96 hours. The reopening was welcomed with relief by merchants, students, workers, and migrants. The binational flow, which is part of the daily routine at the border, regained its usual dynamism. It is expected that the border crossings will continue to operate unless new restrictions are announced.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[\u00daltimas Noticias](https://ultimasnoticias.com.ve/general/reabren-frontera-tachira-y-norte-de-santander/)\n\n**NSA rejects Amnesty's 10,217 death toll claim under Tinubu**\nAmnesty International Nigeria has released a report stating that at least 10,217 people have been killed in Nigeria since President Bola Tinubu took office in 2023. The report claims that the deaths were caused by attacks from gunmen, bandits, and other armed groups, with Benue, Edo, Katsina, Kebbi, Plateau, Sokoto, and Zamfara states affected. The organisation stated that the Nigerian government's failure to protect lives and property has cost thousands of lives and created a potential humanitarian crisis. 'Today marks exactly two years since President Bola Tinubu assumed office with a promise to enhance security. Instead, things have only gotten worse,' said Isa Sanusi, Director, Amnesty International Nigeria. The report also stated that new armed groups have emerged, including Lakurawa in Sokoto and Kebbi states and Mamuda in Kwara State. 'Our investigation verified the killing of over 294 people in Katsina State and documented the abduction of 306 people, mostly women and girls, between May 2023 to May 2025,' the organisation said. Some Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have backed the report, urging the President to commit to protecting the lives of citizens. However, the National Counter Terrorism Centre - Office of the National Security Adviser (NCTC - ONSA) has dismissed the report, stating that several of the figures and assertions contained in the report are inconsistent with verified data in possession of the centre.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/national/nsa-rejects-amnestys-10217-death-toll-claim-under-tinubu/)\n\n**US General Warns of Potential Terrorist Attacks in the US from West Africa**\nGeneral Michael Langley, commander of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM), has warned that the growing influence of 'terrorist' groups in the West African region could lead to attacks in the United States in the near future. Langley stated that the Sahel region, which includes Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, has become a 'center of persistent conflict and a growing case of instability', and is currently the 'global center of terrorism', according to the American website The Hill. He added that 'the ambitions of extremist groups are expanding, and with this expansion, the potential threat to our internal security is becoming more apparent.' The countries of the Sahel have been struggling for years to counter the armed 'terrorist' organizations, which have benefited from military coups to expand their operations. Langley emphasized that the withdrawal of Western forces has weakened Washington's ability to monitor the activities of these groups. He said, 'We have lost the ability to closely follow these groups.' Langley pointed out that networks linked to 'ISIS' and 'Al-Qaeda' are active in the region, particularly in Burkina Faso, where the government has lost control of large areas of its territory, as well as the Lake Chad region between Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. According to Langley, the 'Support for Islam and Muslims' group, known as 'JNIM', has expanded by four times since 2022 and currently controls large areas of Burkina Faso. He explained that the group's main goal is to reach the West African coast, which would allow it to fund its activities through smuggling, human trafficking, and arms trade, adding, 'If they control the coast, they will be able to support terrorism up to the shores of the United States.' Langley's warnings came at a time when Washington is reconsidering its support for development and military programs in Africa, where the Trump administration had canceled several aid programs and is considering redeploying its forces, opening the door for China and Russia to strengthen their influence through investments and partnerships with local governments.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 10:19 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A/)\n\n**General Langley: Sahel is the Epicenter of Terrorism**\nGeneral Langley stated, 'It is in the Sahel that we consider the epicenter of terrorism.

Langley noted that since the US withdrew its troops from Niger in September 2024, he has observed 'an increase in attacks from these extremist organizations' not only in Niger but 'across the Sahel, including in Nigeria.' He emphasized that these increases can be measured by the frequency and complexity of the attacks, driven by persistent socio-economic injustices and the proliferation of arms, as well as the growth of terrorist groups in all domains. Langley admitted that with the US withdrawal from the region, they lost their ability to closely monitor these terrorist groups, but they continue to be in contact with their partners to provide support. He expressed concern about the magnitude and brutality of some of these incidents, which are 'really alarming.' The general also stated that the attacks are 'resurging' in the Lake Chad region, and the extremist groups are becoming 'more aggressive.' Langley's new objective is to gain access to the West African coast, which would allow them to finance operations such as smuggling, human trafficking, and arms trafficking. He warned that this would not only put African nations at risk but also increase the possibility of threats reaching the US coast.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 04:01 PM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2797166/e-no-sahel-que-consideramos-estar-o-epicentro-do-terrorismo)\n\n**Sahel Region Becomes 'Epicenter of Terrorism', Warns US Military Commander**\nThe US military commander in Africa, General Michael Langley, warned that the Sahel region has become 'the epicenter of terrorism' in the world.

While Tehran presents a security agreement as a gesture of goodwill, many are skeptical about its true intentions, particularly regarding Niger's uranium. The agreement includes a protocol for enhanced security cooperation, including information exchange and training, which reflects the convergence of interests between the two countries. Since the July 2023 coup, Niger has been increasingly isolated, with economic sanctions imposed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) before being lifted due to humanitarian concerns. The country has joined the 'Sahel Alliance' with Mali and Burkina Faso, sparking a diplomatic crisis with neighboring countries like Nigeria and Benin. However, the biggest challenge remains security, as Niger has seen a significant increase in terrorist attacks, with 451 deaths in 2024, according to the Global Terrorism Index 2025. Despite the military's efforts to recruit more soldiers, the government recognizes that its security needs external support. With the withdrawal of French and American forces, the field has been opened for alternative powers, with Russia signing a defense agreement with Niger in December 2023 and sending trainers and personnel from the 'Africa Kor' group. However, according to historian and expert on the Sahel region, Dr. Ladjy Wata, this alliance has not delivered on its promises. In contrast, Iran has advanced technologies in drone control, which may tempt Niger, which has lost its air surveillance capabilities after the departure of the US and the transfer of the Agadez base 201, designed for drone operations. Many see this rapprochement as a means for Iran to secure future access to Niger's uranium. Iran is the world's seventh-largest uranium producer, according to the World Nuclear Association (2022). High-level visits, including the Nigerien prime minister's visit to Tehran in early 2024, suggest secret negotiations over supplying Iran with this material, according to the magazine. The latest security agreement supports this hypothesis, and Dr. Wata believes that 'Iran is very realistic in its relations, and there is no doubt that uranium is a key element in this cooperation.' On the other hand, Niger's economy is in a state of contradiction, with a 10% economic growth rate in 2024, but lacking foreign investments due to its political isolation. According to the International Monetary Fund, the government is seeking to rebrand its policy on exploiting natural resources. Before the coup, uranium exports accounted for more than 15% of the country's GDP, but they are now affected by a legal dispute with the French company 'Orano.' Despite maintaining three branches in Niger, Orano announced in December 2024 the loss of control over its activities there, following a rise in tensions with the new regime. The authorities had suspended the license for the Imouraren mine, prompting the company to file two arbitration cases against the Nigerien state. On May 6, 2024, Orano expressed its concern over the searches it was subjected to and the loss of contact with its local representative. In practice, the results are clear, according to the magazine, with around 1,300 tons of uranium still frozen, awaiting uncertain export. The Financial Times revealed on May 17, 2024, the possibility of selling Orano's assets in Niger. According to the newspaper's sources, there is interest from Russian and Chinese parties, as well as a company registered in Cyprus, in addition to the possibility of Nigerien government intervention to buy the majority stake. In summary, the reorganization of Niger's uranium market opens the door for Tehran, which may intensify its security support for Niger in exchange for strategic gains. A 'bilateral deal' is causing concern in Western capitals, which fear the spread of Iranian influence in a highly sensitive region, according to the magazine.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 06:12 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/iran-niger-cooperation-uranium-magic)\n\n**Venezuela Reopens Border with Colombia After Temporary Closure**\nThe Venezuelan authorities reopened the border crossings between the state of T\u00e1chira and the department of Norte de Santander in Colombia on Tuesday, May 27, after a four-day temporary closure due to the regional and parliamentary elections held in Venezuela on Sunday. According to reports by journalist Jonathan Maldonado of La Naci\u00f3n, the barriers at the San Antonio customs entrance were removed before 6:00 am. The movement began immediately, as dozens of pedestrians, motorcyclists, and vehicles waited to cross into Colombia. Many citizens travel daily to C\u00facuta or La Parada, some for work, others for study, and others for medical procedures or migration. The previous closure left many people unable to cross the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge. The border closure, which started at midnight on Friday and lasted until Tuesday morning, caught many citizens by surprise, who were waiting to cross with their luggage, unaware that the border was closed. The government applied the measure for security reasons and informed that the goal was to preserve the inviolability of the borders and prevent activities that could represent threats during the electoral process. It is worth noting that during the temporary closure, a humanitarian channel was opened, which attended to people with health emergencies or special situations. More than 1,000 citizens were assisted during those 96 hours. The reopening was welcomed with relief by merchants, students, workers, and migrants. The binational flow, which is part of the daily routine at the border, regained its usual dynamism. It is expected that the border crossings will continue to operate unless new restrictions are announced.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[\u00daltimas Noticias](https://ultimasnoticias.com.ve/general/reabren-frontera-tachira-y-norte-de-santander/)\n\n**NSA rejects Amnesty's 10,217 death toll claim under Tinubu**\nAmnesty International Nigeria has released a report stating that at least 10,217 people have been killed in Nigeria since President Bola Tinubu took office in 2023. The report claims that the deaths were caused by attacks from gunmen, bandits, and other armed groups, with Benue, Edo, Katsina, Kebbi, Plateau, Sokoto, and Zamfara states affected. The organisation stated that the Nigerian government's failure to protect lives and property has cost thousands of lives and created a potential humanitarian crisis. 'Today marks exactly two years since President Bola Tinubu assumed office with a promise to enhance security. Instead, things have only gotten worse,' said Isa Sanusi, Director, Amnesty International Nigeria. The report also stated that new armed groups have emerged, including Lakurawa in Sokoto and Kebbi states and Mamuda in Kwara State. 'Our investigation verified the killing of over 294 people in Katsina State and documented the abduction of 306 people, mostly women and girls, between May 2023 to May 2025,' the organisation said. Some Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have backed the report, urging the President to commit to protecting the lives of citizens.

Sources described the waterway as a longstanding route for local commerce between the West African nations. The move has disrupted the flow of goods traditionally ferried between rural communities in southwestern Nigeria and southern Benin. Critics, particularly opposition voices within the country, allege a deeper political agenda, suggesting that the continued trade clampdown may be influenced by French geopolitical interests in the region. They suggest that France is backing President Patrice Talon in a long-term strategy to weaken Nigeria's regional economic influence, destabilise the Naira, and pressure West Africa's largest economy to adopt the CFA Franc. 'It is getting clear that it is more political between Cotonou and Abuja than a security matter,' one of the sources said.

The Nigerien authorities have not reopened their border, so traders are using alternative routes, such as crossing the Niger River, to transport goods. Grossist Souley Issifou says, 'We loaded 7,000 sacks this week. When the market is at its peak, we unload over 15,000 sacks per week.' However, the Nigerien authorities have banned the export of staple foods, including peanuts, except to other Sahel Alliance countries. Issifou admits, 'It passes, but it's a risk. The products increase in price due to transportation costs and purchase prices. We currently sell Nigerien peanuts for 44,000 CFA francs.' Some trade between Benin and Niger is done through Nigeria, while others use pirogues to cross the Niger River. Salifou, a truck driver, says, 'We unload at the water's edge, but we don't find a place to unload the same day. We wait 5-6 days to unload. It's by order of arrival.

Despite this limited reopening, relations between Cotonou and Niamey remain marked by deep divergences. The recent recall of Benin's ambassador to Niger, Gildas Agonkan, after his statements in early February, illustrates the persistence of tensions between the two states. While the lifting of restrictions on the river is seen as a gesture of appeasement, observers remain cautious, and it is difficult to predict when the land border might reopen. In the meantime, traders and transporters must still adapt to the constraints imposed by the prolonged closure, which is weighing on economic exchanges between the two countries.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[B\u00e9nin Web TV](https://beninwebtv.com/benin-niger-la-traversee-du-fleuve-entre-les-deux-pays-a-nouveau-autorisee/)\n\n**Benin's Border with Niger Remains Closed, Despite Reopening of River Crossing**\nSince the coup d'\u00e9tat in Niger, the Benin has reopened its border with Niger, but the Niger has kept it closed. The bridge connecting the Beninese city of Malanville to the Nigerien riverbank is still blocked. However, the Beninese authorities have reauthorized the crossing of the Niger River, which was forbidden for 6 months. This small relief is not enough for the merchants of Malanville, who are still waiting for the border to reopen. An student, who had to take a bus to Gaya and then a pirogue to Malanville, said, 'It was a very complicated journey. I have a fear of pirogues near the river. There are often crowds that tend to tip over the pirogue, but what can you do? We have to make do with it for now.' The market, the economic hub of the area, is still well-stocked despite the difficulties.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 05:27 AM\nSource:[Yahoo actualit\u00e9s](https://fr.news.yahoo.com/apr%C3%A8s-reprise-trafic-fluvial-%C3%A0-052741821.html)\n\n**Nigeria opens land, air borders with Niger Republic - CoreTV News**\nNigeria has reopened its land and air borders with Niger Republic, in compliance with a directive by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). According to Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, the presidential directive is in line with ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government's decision at its extraordinary summit on February 24, 2024. Ngelale stated that other sanctions imposed on West African countries, including Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, have also been lifted with immediate effect. The lifted sanctions include the closure of land and air borders, suspension of commercial transactions, freeze of assets, and travel bans on government officials. As Ngelale said, 'ECOWAS leaders had agreed to lift economic sanctions against the Republic of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2024 04:21 PM\nSource:[coretvnews.com](https://www.coretvnews.com/2024/03/13/nigeria-opens-land-air-borders-with-niger-republic/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across eight expert forecasts, the probability that Benin will re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025, is considered low. Forecasters representing perspectives in diplomacy, customs administration, political science, international relations, regional integration, and West African borderland studies largely agree that the prime driver for the closure is a significant and ongoing security threat: specifically, the emergence and activity of the Mahmuda militant group and heightened arms smuggling. Several experts note that, in West Africa, border closures motivated by acute security concerns typically last for multiple months, especially if the instigating threat is persistent, while short-term reopening is more common in closures driven solely by trade disputes or diplomatic signaling.\n\nEconomic hardship and pressure from local communities and Nigerian officials are recognized as factors favoring reopening, but these are seen as insufficient to outweigh security imperatives in the given timeframe. Some partial or controlled reopening (e.g., for humanitarian reasons) is considered possible, but not strongly evidenced by current events or reporting, and would depend on a sudden reduction in threat or a diplomatic breakthrough, neither of which is observed as of late May 2025.\n\nWhile most experts estimate the probability of reopening at between 7% and 20%, one expert, specializing in negotiation theory, is slightly more optimistic (35%), citing the possibility of rapid regional negotiation or security cooperation if conditions improve quickly. Still, this is considered a minority view. The weight of historical precedent, current intelligence assessments, government communications, and ongoing Sahel instability leads the majority to conclude that the crossings will likely remain closed through July 1, 2025, unless an unexpected and public reversal of the immediate security threat emerges."
