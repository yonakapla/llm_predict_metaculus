Media and YouGov polls show him in the low-20s for positive approval; global trackers such as Morning Consult and Ipsos typically lag or smooth these trends, so he'll likely still be near or at the bottom in early July unless a dramatic turnaround occurs. Ishiba faced a sharp scandal-driven drop but has stabilized in the high-20s to low-30s range according to national polls. Absent another major negative shock, he is more likely than Starmer to be above 25%\u2014with Starmer likely at or below that figure. Polling methodology is consistent across both, and the return of Labour to a pre-Corbyn low suggests this is more than a transient blip. The only notable caveat is the possibility of a late-stage rally for one or both, but the base rate and current evidence points to Ishiba having the edge.

Given base rates and trajectory, it is more likely Ishiba will have a (narrowly) higher approval than Starmer on July 1, 2025.

However, Ishiba\u2019s numbers cratered more recently and have less time to recover before July 1. Historically, Japanese PMs with sub-30% approval rarely rebound quickly after a major scandal.

Both remain highly unpopular in global leader comparison rankings, with >60% disapproval. If nothing changes, both would likely be low, but with Ishiba slightly lower, assuming the scandal persists.

Ishiba\u2019s approval crashed after a major scandal to 26% in March; while a minor recovery is possible, historical Japanese base rates suggest sustained low ratings post-scandal. Starmer, however, is in political freefall, with UK poll data giving him among the worst net popularity of any leader in decades amid Labour infighting, economic woes, and a surging Farage. Commentary points to deep public disillusionment with both leaders. From an area studies perspective, the Japanese institutional environment sometimes allows a post-scandal PM to stabilize, while UK PMs facing structural economic/political crises rarely regain ground in a month. Recent Morning Consult summaries show both leaders in low positions, but international media and polling suggest that Starmer\u2019s rating has the greater further-to-fall risk with no visible recovery catalyst. However, short-term factors\u2014such as post-election bumps for Ishiba or new UK turmoil\u2014make this close to a tossup as of today. Given Ishiba\u2019s lows (26% in March), but assuming a small stabilization as the upper house contest becomes the main narrative, and Starmer\u2019s downward momentum likely persists, I judge Ishiba is slightly more likely to be at or above Starmer in early July. Thus, the chance of Starmer being higher seems somewhat less than even.",

Nearly all peer forecasters, including area studies and polling methodology specialists, converge around the same core factors: Starmer's unprecedented, structurally deep unpopularity, the entrenchment of negative media narratives, and lack of plausible recovery paths; and Ishiba's likelihood of stabilizing above his scandal floor, given both Japanese public opinion patterns and a non-escalating domestic news cycle. Crucially, the few more optimistic-for-Starmer estimates are undermined on both theoretical and empirical grounds in the polemic exchanges (including my own critiques), and even the more moderate voices ultimately flag the unlikeliness of a reversal. If anything, the group deliberation exposed a tendency among some to underweight just how sticky and structurally entrenched Starmer's crisis is. There is very little in the additional discussion\u2014or in updated base rates or scenario analysis\u2014that would justify increasing my probability for a 'Yes' outcome. If anything, one could justify lowering it, but 20% remains a defensible, bold, and evidence-based position.",

Multiple forecasters converged on the severe structural, institutional, and media disadvantages facing Starmer and the now well-documented tendency for Japanese PMs\u2019 approvals to stabilize post-scandal. Several also noted the cross-national polling gap: even at his nadir, Ishiba\u2019s numbers are more likely to be in the upper 20s, while Starmer could remain mired below that threshold amid relentless negative coverage and lack of policy wins. No plausible reversal mechanism was credibly identified for Starmer in the next month, and the group\u2019s more decisive probability assignments (20%, 10%, 20%, 23%) are persuasive. My own area studies analysis underweighted the comparative polling resilience of Japanese PMs post-scandal and put too much emphasis on the 'tossup' narrative. Therefore, I am lowering my probability to bring it in line with the broader evidence and arguments.",

The party's support has plummeted to 21%, its lowest rating since October 2019, two months before Labour's crushing defeat in the general election.

Reform UK is now leading Labour by eight points, with the Tories two points behind. The party's relations with former leader Jeremy Corbyn have also broken down, with Corbyn being suspended from the party over his response to an anti-semitism probe and later re-elected as an independent MP. Starmer has refused to give Corbyn the Labour whip back, saying 'Just F*****g Do It' in response to pressure to U-turn on the winter fuel policy. 'It's a huge blow to Starmer,' said a Labour insider.

The government plans to implement reforms to boost growth, while understanding the reasons behind the return of economic nationalism. Starmer is expected to announce on April 7 that globalization is reaching its end, acknowledging that it has not brought the expected benefits to a large portion of the population, as reported by the Sunday Times. This move comes as the new US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump cause global repercussions. 'Trump has done things we don't approve of, but there's a reason why the population supports his decision. The world has changed, globalization is over, and we are now in a new era,' said a Downing Street representative, as cited by the Sunday Times. Other world leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahou, are expected to engage in dialogue with Trump. However, Elon Musk has taken a different stance, advocating for the removal of trade barriers between the US and Europe and increased freedom of movement between the two continents, aiming to create a true transatlantic free trade zone.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: April 06, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[RT en Fran\u00e7ais](https://francais.rt.com/international/118979-londres-fin-mondialisation)\n\n**Japanese Premier Ishiba's Cabinet approval hits record low after gift scandal**\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's approval rating has hit a record low after he handed out gift vouchers worth 100,000 yen ($673) each to 15 first-term lower house lawmakers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). According to the latest polls, Ishiba's approval rating plummeted 14 percentage points to 26% from the previous survey done in February. Ishiba said he used 'pocket money' to hand out gift certificates to the lawmakers as a 'show of appreciation' for their hard work getting elected. However, he apologized for his action, which caused 'distrust and anger among many people.'

According to a poll conducted by the Asahi newspaper, the approval rating slid 14 percentage points to 26% from the previous survey, the worst since Ishiba took office last October. Ishiba defended his actions, saying he used 'pocket money' to hand out gift certificates as a 'show of appreciation' for their hard work, but apologized for causing 'distrust and anger among many people.' All 15 lawmakers returned the gift vouchers to Ishiba's office.

According to YouGov, the Prime Minister is now more popular than Reform's Nigel Farage for the first time since September. Meanwhile, Reform UK voters are turning against Donald Trump, with a 25-point increase in negative views of the president since mid-February. By contrast, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has increased in popularity, with 71% of Britons now having a favourable view of the Ukrainian leader. Nigel Farage's numbers have worsened, with a quarter of Britons (26%) now having a positive view of him, down from 30% in mid-February. Farage's latest net favourability score of -39 is 11 points lower than Starmer's. A Reform UK spokesman said, 'We are a grassroots political party funded by the mass membership and not reliant on any single large donor.' However, the party has struggled to attract donations since winning five seats in the election last July, with \u00a3281,000 made in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to \u00a3350,000 personally topped up by Farage from outside work in the same period.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:41 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14468457/Keir-Starmers-boosted-Ukraine-leadership-Brits-Donald-Trump-Reform-voters.html)\n\n**Keir Starmer's Approval Rating Reaches 31% in the UK**\nAccording to a recent YouGov poll, only 31% of British citizens have a positive view of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

    "summary": "Experts overwhelmingly forecast that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will NOT have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025, according to Morning Consult. The dominant reasons are:\n\n- Starmer's approval is on a sharp downward trajectory, with historic lows for both himself and the Labour party, compounded by policy reversals, economic malaise, internal party struggles, and the rise of Reform UK and Nigel Farage. Media narratives in the UK are relentlessly negative, and there are no expected positive catalysts for a turnaround before July.\n- Ishiba suffered a sharp drop to 26% approval in March due to a scandal, but signs point to stabilization or modest recovery, with Japanese media shifting attention to diplomacy, trade, and economic growth. Japanese approval for PMs in the aftermath of scandals typically does not collapse further without new events, and some recovery is possible.\n- Cross-national base rates show UK PMs in crisis and with heavy media negativity often fall to very low levels (sometimes below Japanese PMs at their nadir), while Japanese PMs\u2014though volatile\u2014may bottom out and modestly recover barring fresh scandal.\n- The comparative forecasting consensus\u2014along with rationale from political polling, media sentiment, comparative leadership, public opinion theory, and area-studies experts\u2014places Starmer's likely approval in early July below, or at best equal to, Ishiba's. Only one expert (PoliticalScienceDemocraticAccountability) gives Starmer a better than even chance, arguing that Ishiba's scandal recovery may stall; all others expect Ishiba to have the edge, absent a dramatic, unexpected event.\n- Most expert probability estimates for Starmer having a higher rating than Ishiba range from 10% to 38%; only one forecast is above 50% (at 60%). The central tendency is a strong 'No.'\n\nUnless there is a sudden reversal (e.g., a fresh Ishiba crisis or Starmer polling surge), the group consensus is that Starmer will not surpass Ishiba's approval rating by July 1, 2025."
