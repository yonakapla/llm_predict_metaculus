He references a desire to 'wait and see' how the field shapes up and mentions the possibility of supporting or recruiting other candidates for his new party. The current, detailed focus on party-building (not candidacy-building), coupled with the fresh entry of David Jolly as Democratic front-runner, surface reporting that Morgan has 'not ruled out' but is not running, and the lack of precedent for late high-profile third-party entries strongly suggest he is unlikely to announce a run before the end of June. While his wealth and media profile give him theoretical capacity for a rapid campaign launch, nothing in his behavior or reporting indicates a move toward official candidacy within the next three weeks. Based on base rates for last-minute Florida entries, the substance of recent journalism, and Morgan's own on-the-record comments, the probability of an affirmative, public announcement before July 1 is low\u2014though not quite zero, given his personal unpredictability and resources.

Importantly, Jolly\u2019s just-declared candidacy positions him as the leading Democrat, drastically reducing Morgan\u2019s incentives to jump in within a 25-day window. Morgan is simultaneously working on establishing a new party, and his attention is divided between party-building and candidate decision, further diluting the odds.

Even the dissenting language about unpredictability is framed as a character tic rather than a real campaign indicator. Your emphasis on how these signals reduce newsrooms' willingness to report a declaration as imminent matches current election cycle reporting standards. That's spot-on. A surprise is always possible with a billionaire maverick, but the framing and meta-framing at work here gives the public\u2014and, crucially, the press gatekeepers\u2014every reason to keep the campaign probability very low.

Morgan has already proven he can bankroll ballot initiatives statewide\u2014he doesn\u2019t need traditional consultant choreography to inject himself into the race at the eleventh hour (especially as a vanity/statement candidate). The fixation on the 'party-building, not candidacy-building' dichotomy is also overhyped: the two can remain intentionally blurry until the declaration moment, especially when press coverage is already primed for spectacle. Sure, odds are low, but your certainty veers too close to assuming Morgan plays by institutional rules\u2014he demonstrably does not.

You correctly note that in the modern South, especially Florida, real outsider candidacies do not spring up in a vacuum: they require extensive groundwork, validation from the political class, and a stronger sense of timing than any last-minute 'blitz' would allow.

The notion that resources can substitute for time and narrative groundwork is a pipe dream at this scale, especially in Florida. In fact, the whole possibility of a last-minute shock campaign flouts every observable trend in both Morgan's public messaging and statewide political choreography\u2014you give unpredictability too much credit. Your 10% probability is a hedge against being surprised, not a rational reading of how elite actors successfully set the agenda.

The polemics further stress that unpredictability here is a weak justification on its own, given Morgan's well-established pattern of public flirtation but ultimate non-entry.

The only dissent (Rational Choice) overestimates unpredictability and underestimates organizational/structural barriers, and was effectively critiqued for this. Defenses from Florida/regional and Southern-tradition perspectives reinforce that media hype and wealth do not negate the brutally low odds for last-minute major gubernatorial entries, especially given Morgan's own ongoing equivocation and strong alternative incentives for him to stay a party-builder, not a candidate.

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**David Jolly Announces Democratic Candidacy for Florida Governor**\nDavid Jolly, a 52-year-old former Republican congressman, has announced his candidacy as a Democrat to govern Florida. Jolly, who represented Florida's 13th Congressional District from 2014 to 2017, left the Republican Party in 2018 due to disagreements with Donald Trump's ideas. Despite the challenges Democrats face in winning the election next year, Jolly decided to run as the Democratic candidate. 'Let's end the politics of division and return Florida to voters who simply want a working economy, the best education system in the world, safe communities, and a government that stays out of our medical consultations and family decisions,' he said. When asked about his past as a Republican, Jolly stated that he never fully agreed with the party's principles and decided to end his relationship with them. 'It cost me to exercise those values in the Republican Party. The real registration as a Democrat was not a change. It was a formality,' he said. Jolly's mission to become the governor of Florida is complicated, as Republicans have made it a stronghold for over two decades. However, Jolly's path is clear after Jason William Barnet Pizzo, a former state senator, announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. 'We can clean up corruption in Tallahassee. It's time for women and doctors to make healthcare decisions, not politicians. We can resolve affordability crises, reduce costs, and lower insurance rates,' Jolly warns on his website.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https://laopinion.com/2025/06/05/david-jolly-excongresista-republicano-se-postula-como-candidato-democrata-a-gobernador-de-florida/)\n\n**Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announces run for Florida governor**\nFormer U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, citing the state's affordability crisis as a major issue. Jolly stated, 'We have an affordability crisis in Florida driven by an insurance crisis that continues to worsen in the face of complete neglect by Tallahassee.

Jolly, who represented Florida's 13th Congressional District from 2014 to 2017, left the Republican Party in 2018 due to disagreements with Donald Trump's ideas. Despite the challenges Democrats face in winning the election next year, Jolly decided to run as the Democratic candidate. 'Let's end the politics of division and return Florida to voters who simply want a working economy, the best education system in the world, safe communities, and a government that stays out of our medical consultations and family decisions,' he said. When asked about his past as a Republican, Jolly stated that he never fully agreed with the party's principles and decided to end his relationship with them. 'It cost me to exercise those values in the Republican Party. The real registration as a Democrat was not a change. It was a formality,' he said. Jolly's mission to become the governor of Florida is complicated, as Republicans have made it a stronghold for over two decades. However, Jolly's path is clear after Jason William Barnet Pizzo, a former state senator, announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. 'We can clean up corruption in Tallahassee. It's time for women and doctors to make healthcare decisions, not politicians. We can resolve affordability crises, reduce costs, and lower insurance rates,' Jolly warns on his website.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https://laopinion.com/2025/06/05/david-jolly-excongresista-republicano-se-postula-como-candidato-democrata-a-gobernador-de-florida/)\n\n**Former Republican Congressman David Jolly to Run for Florida Governor as Democrat**\nFormer Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his candidacy for governor of Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, a critic of Donald Trump, believes that issues such as affordability, public school funding, and campaign finance reform will resonate with voters in 2026. He predicts that the elections next year will signal a national change. 'I think the Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should take the politicians out of the classrooms and the doctor's offices,' said Jolly. 'I think many people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that the cultural wars have gone too far,' he added. Jolly, a lawyer and former state representative, has undergone a political evolution that led him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 and become an independent and later a registered Democrat. He has gained a national profile as an anti-Trump commentator on MSNBC. Jolly said he has considered himself 'part of the Democratic coalition' for about five years and believes in what he considers the 'fundamental values' of the party: that government can help people, that the economy should be 'just' for all, and that immigrants should be celebrated. 'It cost me to exercise those values in the Republican Party,' Jolly said, and continued: 'Registering as a Democrat was not a radical change. It was a formality.' Jolly has distanced himself from his former party on the issue of immigration, while Florida lawmakers rush to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly harshly criticized Republicans, who, according to him, have 'combined immigration and crime,' which he described as incorrect and immoral.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[telemundo51.com](https://www.telemundo51.com/noticias/local/david-jolly-excongresista-republicano-se-postulara-para-gobernador-de-florida-como-democrata/2664341/)\n\n**Former U.S. Rep.

    "summary": "All experts, from diverse fields such as campaign consulting, journalism, political science, communication studies, and regional studies, assign a very low probability (ranging from 3% to 10%) that John Morgan will announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025. The consensus reasoning rests on several key factors: \n\n- Morgan has not yet announced and is focused on launching a new centrist party, rather than a direct gubernatorial campaign.\n- He has publicly stated a 'wait-and-see' approach, consistently signaling indecision and hesitancy in his messaging.\n- The recent entry of prominent candidates such as David Jolly (Democrat) and Jason Pizzo (Independent) has crystallized the field, making a late Morgan entry less strategically advantageous.\n- Logistical and organizational challenges of launching a credible campaign and new party within such a short time frame are seen as formidable.\n- Multiple analysts point to Morgan\u2019s pattern of teasing runs in previous cycles, only to ultimately refrain from entering the race.\n- The historical base rate for ultra-late, high-profile entry\u2014especially from non-traditional or billionaire candidates\u2014is extremely low in Florida politics.\n- While Morgan's wealth and media profile theoretically enable a rapid pivot, none see significant current movement towards an imminent announcement; all signals and press coverage underline party-building, not campaign launch.\n\nYes-scenarios are generally described as highly contingent, 'black swan' events (e.g., a major rival's implosion or an unexpected surge in demand), but these are universally deemed unlikely. The consensus, reflected across all expert analyses, is that Morgan is extremely unlikely to announce a gubernatorial run before the deadline, with the most common forecast clustered at 3-7% probability."
