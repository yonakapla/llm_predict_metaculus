Calendar tailwinds (an extra working day) that inflated previous months\u2019 numbers will not repeat, and the vast majority of industries are seeing weak or negative growth. Furthermore, global headwinds (China and Korea manufacturing slumps) and the intensification of tariff-induced cost shocks add crosscurrents, potentially hampering both domestic and export-driven output. Positives such as tech/AI investment and solid service sector expansion may cushion the fall, but not enough to decisively tilt the outcome given the breadth of contraction signals from both district and sectoral data. Thus, the base rate for positive May YoY growth is low (historically, sharp slowdowns after energy- or calendar-driven blips often presage a temporary stall or dip), but not zero\u2014resilience in energy and inventories could barely keep the YoY number above water.

Unless May sees a large, broad contraction or a sharp drop in energy output, it would take a notably negative print\u2014far worse than trend/expectation\u2014to cause the YoY rate to drop to/below zero. The most likely scenario, absent a new shock, is that IP moderates but stays slightly positive YoY, with energy providing a floor. This judgment is strengthened by the business cycle pattern: deep negative YoY prints usually require US GDP to be more clearly in recession, which is not currently evidenced elsewhere in macro data. The risk is moderate but not high: the major concern is if April\u2019s energy strength was a one-off and May\u2019s manufacturing weakness deepens, but real-time data (labor, consumption) does not suggest a sudden IP cliff.

The IS curve is under pressure from weak net exports and investment, while the LM curve offers little offset as the Fed is on hold amid high (but not rising) rates, and banks have not broadly loosened credit. Consumer spending is slowing, not accelerating. However, robust energy output, some inventory effects, and solid personal income/savings do provide cushions. The S&P 500 rally and optimistic AI-driven sectors are unlikely to immediately feed through to May's industrial output statistics. Probability of a negative YoY reading is now distinctly elevated compared to the base rate, but a modestly positive print (0 to +1%) remains more likely than not due to headline resilience in energy and inventories.

You also give too little credence to calendar distortion, which when added to broad US manufacturing malaise, is the exact scenario where history's tenuous inertia patterns break down. This isn't a mean-reverting time series\u2014it's a sectoral cliff edge with policy shocks added. In short: your probability is too high by about 10\u201315 points. You're mistaking lack of 'hard break' for ongoing drift. In these edge conditions, macro-geographic and sectoral structure trumps sequential stats."

The downside risks (sharp base effect reversal, sectoral contraction, negative regional data) are more immediate and potentially stronger than the support from tech/energy inertia. While headline resilience, energy, and inventories remain a cushion, a modest negative MoM print could push the YoY number right to or just below zero. The modal scenario is still a marginally positive YoY, but the risk of a negative print is clearly higher than my initial assessment.

No new evidence was provided that would materially improve the outlook for May. If anything, group consensus and argumentation slightly strengthen the bearish case: other sector specialists also warn of how base effects and month-to-month volatility can drive the YoY growth figure negative despite headline resilience.

The warning that non-recessionary negative prints occur at a higher conditional frequency when index growth is barely above zero is compelling\u2014especially as the base effect and sectoral headwinds coincide. I continue to believe the probability of a drop below zero remains sub-50% barring a shock, due to energy/inventory resilience and lack of broader macro collapse, but I now give more weight to mechanical reversal and the plausibility of a minor negative swing.

The structural perspective I praised is the strongest counter, reinforcing that calendar effects and widespread sectoral malaise mean downside risks are higher than headline aggregates imply.

The defense of my SCP-focused, granular approach emphasizes how negative momentum in 80+% of industry, combined with policy/tariff drag and lost calendar tailwind, makes a near-threshold flip to negative very plausible without needing a recessionary shock. The points raised about sectoral heterogeneity, regional survey depth, and mechanical calendar effects further support my modest baseline. However, several critiques prompt a slight upward revision: historical base rates and energy/tech cushions do occasionally prevent an immediate drop into negative, and their proponents raise valid arguments about short-term headline inertia.

My own critique of TimeSeries reinforced the risk of underestimating how quickly a near-threshold YoY figure can go negative with even mild sequential slippage, especially after an artificially inflated April.

However, they did not come to a consensus on the reason for this surge. According to CMAS, the 'stagnationary positive' in April was primarily due to 'increased oil extraction and processing.' The analysts estimated that oil extraction increased by 1.2% in April, while gas extraction did not grow (-0.4% in April after -0.5% on average in the first quarter). The growth in oil processing volumes (2.2% in April against -0.1% on average in the first quarter) was likely due to an increase in exports. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline in production since the beginning of the year, with a 0.7% monthly decline on average in January-April, including a 0.4% decline in April. The CMAS analysts also noted that in April, as in March 2025, there was one more working day than a year ago, and without accounting for the positive calendar effect, the industrial production index would not have exceeded 101%, and in civil processing industries, it would have been 97.4%. Within these industries, there is a halt in the decline in food production, a decline in the production of medicines, rubber and plastic products, signs of slowing down in the decline in the production of building materials, a resumption of growth in the production of computers, electronics and optical devices, an increase in production in the automotive industry, and a decline in the production of machines and equipment. In contrast, according to the analysts of Raiffeisenbank, the growth of industry (by their estimate, 0.5% in April compared to March, taking into account seasonality) is provided by the machine-building complex - +0.7 percentage points in the dynamics of the overall index, while the other industries made a negative contribution of 0.2 percentage points. 'This, in our opinion, indicates that the cooling of economic activity in a wide range of industries (84% of the entire industry) continues,' the bank's experts concluded. In turn, the assessments of economists from the Telegram channel 'Tverdye tsifry' (in the pool of the Central Bank), although closer to the assessments of CMAS, do not record a decline in the production of machines and equipment. According to them, with a seasonal adjustment, industrial production in April increased by 0.3% compared to March: in extraction by 0.9%, and in processing did not change. Within processing, the leaders were computers, electronics and optics (+5.3% in April with a seasonal adjustment), tobacco (+3.4%), and other machines and equipment (+2%), while the laggards were leather products (-10.9%), printing (-8.7%), other transport equipment (-7.9%), and finished metal products (-5.8%).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7774003)\n\n**US Markets Prepare for Crucial Week of Economic Data and Financial Legislation**\nInvestors are looking forward to a crucial week of economic data and financial legislation in the US. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices have recorded their largest monthly gains since November 2023, with the S&P 500 up 6.2% and Nasdaq up 9.6%. The data includes employment numbers for May, which are expected to show an addition of 130,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll of economists. However, some analysts believe that a strong employment report could be seen as negative by the markets, potentially delaying a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The focus is also on Washington, where the Senate is set to begin studying a tax and spending bill that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. The bill is expected to add $3.8 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade, raising concerns about the impact on the bond market. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs imposed by President Trump is also a factor, with some analysts expecting a strong employment report to be seen as negative by the markets. 'Now that we're back at these record levels, the data needs to be strong enough to beat expectations for the markets to continue to rise,' said Scott Wren, global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. 'The May employment report reflects the first full month that companies have had to deal with the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, and the pressure in the market,' said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. However, some analysts believe that a strong employment report could be seen as negative by the markets, potentially delaying a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. 'We've seen a lot of hype, then the market realizes this is just another chapter in a long story, and it doesn't add much clarity to the picture,' said Eric Kobrick, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/economy/business/stock-markets/82623)\n\n**S&P 500 Sees Largest Monthly Gain Since November 2023**\nThe S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since February, with a gain of 6.2% in May, according to Reuters. The index also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023, with a gain of 9.6% in May. The market was volatile in May, with investors on edge due to Trump's unpredictable trade policies. However, his softened stance on tariffs, combined with optimistic earnings and low inflation data, helped the S&P 500 recover from its lowest level in April. The S&P 500 ended the month with a slight gain, despite a volatile session on Friday, as Trump criticized China on his 'Truth Social' platform, but later expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal. Dollarhyde said, 'February, March, and April were the worst three months since COVID, so we needed some gains.' The US tariffs on imports have increased from 2-3% before Trump took office to around 15% currently, according to Oxford Economics. A court ruling could have lowered this rate to around 6%, but a stay of execution by the appeals court kept the higher rate in place. The market also digested data showing a 2.1% annual increase in US consumer spending in April, following a 2.3% increase in March. The Federal Reserve is monitoring personal consumption expenditure prices to determine its 2% inflation target. Investors also maintained their bets that the Fed will cut its short-term borrowing costs in September.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_economy/details/2025/6/1/2797192/-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A2%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B2-500-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%B3%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B0-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1-2023)\n\n**China's Industrial Production Contracts for Second Straight Month Amid Trade Tensions**\nChina's industrial production contracted for the second consecutive month in May, according to an official survey released on Saturday. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.5 from 49.0 in April, but remained below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The PMI for the service sector, which includes construction, fell to 50.3 from 50.4. However, the sub-index for new orders improved to 49.8 from 49.2 in April, and the sub-index for new export orders rose to 47.5 from 44.7. The data suggests that further economic stimulus measures may be needed to support the economy amid the ongoing trade tensions with the US. US President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a bilateral agreement to reduce tariffs, and has threatened to double global steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. 'The recent developments between China and the US indicate that bilateral relations are not improving,' said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 'Companies in China and the US that are active in international trade must conduct their business under persistently high uncertainty, which will weigh on growth prospects in both countries.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 06:44 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/konjunktur-chinas-industrieproduktion-schrumpft-inmitten-von-handelsspannungen/100130802.html)\n\n**May Stock Market Sees Highest 5-Month Gain in 35 Years, Investors Eye June**\nThe S&P 500 index rose by 6% in May, its largest 5-month gain in 35 years, and investors are watching to see if this trend will continue in June. The 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and NVIDIA, reported a 27.7% average increase in profits in the first quarter, exceeding market expectations. Drew Peacock, a US stock strategist at Citi, said, 'The Magnificent Seven performed better than other stocks in the recent market rally.' He added, 'In a situation where there is uncertainty about the economy, investment, and consumer sentiment, it's better to invest in companies that can grow.' Investors are paying attention to the upcoming economic data releases, including the manufacturing and employment indicators, to predict the trend. The ISM manufacturing index is expected to rise to 49.5 in May, while the S&P Global's US Manufacturing PMI is expected to remain at 52.3. The JOLTS report, which measures labor market conditions, is expected to show 7.07 million job openings in March, down from 7.19 million in the previous month. The ADP employment report is expected to show 110,000 new jobs in May, up from 62,200 in the previous month. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which provides regional economic data, will also be released. The weekly initial unemployment claims, ISM non-manufacturing index, and S&P Global's services PMI will also be released. The most anticipated data release is the May employment report, which is expected to show 135,000 new non-farm jobs and a 4.2% unemployment rate. The average hourly earnings, average weekly hours worked, and labor force participation rate will also be released, which will influence the Fed's future monetary policy direction.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 01:24 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250602_0003198538)\n\n**South Korean Manufacturing Activity Shrinks for 4th Month, New Orders See Largest Decline Since 2020**\nSouth Korea's manufacturing activity contracted for the 4th month in a row, according to the S&P Global PMI, which rose to 47.7 in May from 47.5 in April. The index has been below the 50-point mark since February, indicating a decline in growth. Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, stated, 'The manufacturing sector in South Korea started the month of May with an unstable base.' He attributed the decline to the ongoing stagnation of the domestic economy and the continued effects of higher US tariffs on the domestic market and key export markets. New orders saw the largest decline since June 2020, while production fell as strongly as it has not in over two and a half years. The global trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump has further exacerbated the already weak demand situation in South Korea, which recently experienced its worst wildfires on record and is struggling with political unrest. The trade-dependent economy contracted unexpectedly in the first quarter, increasing pressure on policymakers to boost demand. The Bank of Korea lowered interest rates for the fourth time in its current easing cycle and halved its economic growth forecast for this year to 0.8%, citing downward risks from US tariff policy and weak construction activity. The PMI survey also showed a decline in order books for the second month in a row, with the decline being as strong as it has not been in almost five years, given the cautious new orders. However, manufacturers are again optimistic and have overcome the negative sentiment in April, partly due to hopes for a relaxation of global trade tensions. However, confidence was only cautious and reflected ongoing concerns about the impact of tariffs.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/nachrichten/Sudkoreanische-Fabrikaktivitat-schrumpft-erneut-neue-Auftrage-verzeichnen-laut-PMI-den-starkste-50125188/)\n\n**Industrial Production Sees Unexpected Rebound in April 2025**\nAnalysts from the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-term Forecasting (CMAS) investigated the cause of the unexpected positive rebound in industrial production in April 2025, which accelerated to 1.5% year-over-year from 0.8% in March.

Within these industries, there is a halt in the decline in food production, a decline in the production of medicines, rubber and plastic products, signs of slowing down in the decline in the production of building materials, a resumption of growth in the production of computers, electronics and optical devices, an increase in production in the automotive industry, and a decline in the production of machines and equipment. In contrast, according to the analysts of Raiffeisenbank, the growth of industry (by their estimate, 0.5% in April compared to March, taking into account seasonality) is provided by the machine-building complex - +0.7 percentage points in the dynamics of the overall index, while the other industries made a negative contribution of 0.2 percentage points. 'This, in our opinion, indicates that the cooling of economic activity in a wide range of industries (84% of the entire industry) continues,' the bank's experts concluded. In turn, the assessments of economists from the Telegram channel 'Tverdye tsifry' (in the pool of the Central Bank), although closer to the assessments of CMAS, do not record a decline in the production of machines and equipment. According to them, with a seasonal adjustment, industrial production in April increased by 0.3% compared to March: in extraction by 0.9%, and in processing did not change. Within processing, the leaders were computers, electronics and optics (+5.3% in April with a seasonal adjustment), tobacco (+3.4%), and other machines and equipment (+2%), while the laggards were leather products (-10.9%), printing (-8.7%), other transport equipment (-7.9%), and finished metal products (-5.8%).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7774003)\n\n**US Markets Prepare for Crucial Week of Economic Data and Financial Legislation**\nInvestors are looking forward to a crucial week of economic data and financial legislation in the US. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices have recorded their largest monthly gains since November 2023, with the S&P 500 up 6.2% and Nasdaq up 9.6%. The data includes employment numbers for May, which are expected to show an addition of 130,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll of economists. However, some analysts believe that a strong employment report could be seen as negative by the markets, potentially delaying a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The focus is also on Washington, where the Senate is set to begin studying a tax and spending bill that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. The bill is expected to add $3.8 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade, raising concerns about the impact on the bond market. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs imposed by President Trump is also a factor, with some analysts expecting a strong employment report to be seen as negative by the markets. 'Now that we're back at these record levels, the data needs to be strong enough to beat expectations for the markets to continue to rise,' said Scott Wren, global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. 'The May employment report reflects the first full month that companies have had to deal with the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, and the pressure in the market,' said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. However, some analysts believe that a strong employment report could be seen as negative by the markets, potentially delaying a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. 'We've seen a lot of hype, then the market realizes this is just another chapter in a long story, and it doesn't add much clarity to the picture,' said Eric Kobrick, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/economy/business/stock-markets/82623)\n\n**US Employment Indicators to be Released This Week**\nThis week, the US will release various employment indicators, including the May non-agricultural employment report, which is expected to show a 12.5 million increase in new hires. Despite a 5.2 million decrease from last month, the report is expected to be 'good'. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which will be released on April 4, will also be closely watched. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a speech on April 2, where he is expected to reaffirm the independence of the Fed. The US economy has shown a stronger-than-expected trend despite high tariffs, but consumer spending has slowed down and companies are hesitant to hire, indicating a weakening labor market. The ADP report, which will be released on April 4, is also expected to show a 5 million increase in private sector employment. The weekly initial unemployment claims report will be released on April 5. The ISM's May manufacturing index, which will be released on April 2, is expected to show a 49.3 reading, which is slightly higher than the 48.7 reading in April but still below the benchmark of 50, indicating a continued contraction in the economy.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource:[\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uacbd\uc81c](https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2025060200283464636)\n\n**S&P 500 Sees Largest Monthly Gain Since November 2023**\nThe S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since February, with a gain of 6.2% in May, according to Reuters. The index also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023, with a gain of 9.6% in May. The market was volatile in May, with investors on edge due to Trump's unpredictable trade policies. However, his softened stance on tariffs, combined with optimistic earnings and low inflation data, helped the S&P 500 recover from its lowest level in April. The S&P 500 ended the month with a slight gain, despite a volatile session on Friday, as Trump criticized China on his 'Truth Social' platform, but later expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal. Dollarhyde said, 'February, March, and April were the worst three months since COVID, so we needed some gains.' The US tariffs on imports have increased from 2-3% before Trump took office to around 15% currently, according to Oxford Economics. A court ruling could have lowered this rate to around 6%, but a stay of execution by the appeals court kept the higher rate in place. The market also digested data showing a 2.1% annual increase in US consumer spending in April, following a 2.3% increase in March. The Federal Reserve is monitoring personal consumption expenditure prices to determine its 2% inflation target. Investors also maintained their bets that the Fed will cut its short-term borrowing costs in September.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_economy/details/2025/6/1/2797192/-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A2%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B2-500-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%B3%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B0-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1-2023)\n\n**South Korea's Economy Faces 0% Growth Rate Amid Sluggish Domestic Demand**\nSouth Korea's domestic demand has been sluggish, with a 0.2% decrease in average sales of consumer goods from January to April compared to the same period last year. The manufacturing sector has also seen a decline, with a 2.9% increase in production index from January to April, which is half of the 6.1% increase seen in the same period in 2022. The construction industry has also been affected, with a 21.0% decrease in construction production from January to April compared to the same period last year. The decline in manufacturing growth, combined with the weakening of domestic demand and the impact of US tariffs, has led to a forecast of a 0% growth rate for South Korea's economy this year. The Bank of Korea has also lowered its forecast for South Korea's real GDP growth rate to 0.8% from 1.5% last month.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 04:29 AM\nSource:[\uc138\uacc4\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.segye.com/newsView/20250601505364)\n\n**Chinese Industry Contracts for Second Month in a Row**\nThe Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), a key indicator of industrial production, stood at 49.5 this month, higher than the 49 recorded in April. However, a score of 50 or above is required to indicate growth, while a lower score suggests contraction in business activity. The temporary suspension of high tariffs between Beijing and Washington has led to lower import duties, but it remains to be seen how long this situation will last. According to a spokesperson from the National Bureau of Statistics, the overall business activity in the Chinese economy continued to grow in May. The Chinese government aims for an economic growth of 5% this year, a goal considered ambitious by many economists due to the country's struggles with weak domestic consumption.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 11:38 AM\nSource:[Zeelandnet](https://www.zeelandnet.nl/nieuws/bedrijvigheid-chinese-industrie-krimpt-tweede-maand-op-rij)\n\n**China's Industrial Production Contracts for Second Straight Month Amid Trade Tensions**\nChina's industrial production contracted for the second consecutive month in May, according to an official survey released on Saturday. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.5 from 49.0 in April, but remained below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The PMI for the service sector, which includes construction, fell to 50.3 from 50.4. However, the sub-index for new orders improved to 49.8 from 49.2 in April, and the sub-index for new export orders rose to 47.5 from 44.7. The data suggests that further economic stimulus measures may be needed to support the economy amid the ongoing trade tensions with the US. US President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a bilateral agreement to reduce tariffs, and has threatened to double global steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. 'The recent developments between China and the US indicate that bilateral relations are not improving,' said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 'Companies in China and the US that are active in international trade must conduct their business under persistently high uncertainty, which will weigh on growth prospects in both countries.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 06:44 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/konjunktur-chinas-industrieproduktion-schrumpft-inmitten-von-handelsspannungen/100130802.html)\n\n**US Economy Releases Key Data for April, Showing Significant Decline in Imports and Narrowing Trade Deficit**\nThe US economy released key economic data for April, which showed a significant decline in imports, a narrowing trade deficit, and a slowdown in consumer spending. According to the US Department of Commerce, US imports fell by 19.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since 1992, to $2.76 trillion. The trade deficit also narrowed to $876 billion, lower than market expectations of $1.43 trillion. Meanwhile, exports remained relatively stable, growing by 3.4% to $1.88 trillion. Inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, rose by 2.5% year-over-year, meeting market expectations and reaching a four-year low. However, economists warn that the inflation situation remains uncertain, and the impact of tariffs on consumer prices is expected to increase in May and June. Consumer spending growth slowed to 0.2% in April, while personal income growth accelerated to 0.8%, the largest increase since January 2024. As a result, the savings rate rebounded to 4.9%, the highest level since April 2024. This suggests that despite the slowdown in consumer spending, Americans' financial foundation remains relatively stable, with improved savings capacity providing potential resilience for future consumption. The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain a wait-and-see approach, keeping interest rates unchanged unless consumer spending declines sharply or unemployment rises rapidly. Despite this, the market expects the Fed to start reducing interest rates from September. In terms of capital flows, global stock funds experienced the largest single-week net outflow of $95 billion in May 2025, while emerging market stock funds saw a net inflow of $20 billion. Gold funds received $18 billion in inflows, with a record-breaking $750 billion in annual inflows. The weak dollar has triggered a rotation effect, with various assets experiencing inflows, including cryptocurrencies, gold, emerging market bonds, and stocks. REITs also saw a net inflow of $3 billion, a new high since October 2024. US Bank believes that the dollar is entering a bear market, primarily due to the inability of the tariff policy to push the dollar index above 100, and that a weak dollar will help to revive the US manufacturing sector, which currently accounts for only 8% of employment.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6001944)\n\n**Taiwan's Industrial Production Index Reaches New High in April**\nThe April industrial production index reached 107.51, a year-on-year increase of 22.31%, setting a record for 14 consecutive months and a new high for the same period. This is due to the strong demand for AI, the temporary suspension of US equal tariffs, and the resulting surge in inventory. The Ministry of Economic Affairs predicts that the index will continue to grow, with a year-on-year increase of 15% in May. The electronics components, semiconductor, and computer electronics and optical products industries have all set new monthly highs, with the electronics components and semiconductor industries experiencing 16 and 22 consecutive months of growth, respectively. The Ministry of Economic Affairs attributes the growth to the strong demand for high-performance computing and AI applications, as well as the increasing demand for semiconductors and computer electronics. However, traditional industries have had mixed results, with the chemical materials and fertilizers industry and the automotive and parts industry experiencing negative growth. The Ministry of Economic Affairs predicts that the May industrial production index will be between 108.67 and 112.67, with a year-on-year increase of 11% to 15.1%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/paper/1708175)\n\n**US Business Activity Shows Signs of Recovery**\nAccording to S&P Global, US business activity in May showed signs of recovery, with the composite PMI index rising to 52.1 points from 50.6 points in April. This growth is largely due to the 90-day trade war truce between Washington and Beijing, which has allowed American manufacturers to expect a recovery in Chinese imports in the coming months. Additionally, business activity in May was supported by expectations of tax relief announced by US President Donald Trump, with the bill being passed by the House of Representatives on May 22. The manufacturing PMI index increased to 52.3 points in May, the highest since June 2022, while the subindex for production returned to positive territory at 50.7 points. The 15-month high was reached by the new orders volume indicator, which rose to 52.4 points. The inventory levels indicator, which measures the dynamics of inventory levels, contributed the most to the growth of industrial PMI, reaching a record 57 points, the highest since 2009. This is due to manufacturers expecting a significant increase in prices for intermediate goods and preferring to maintain significant volumes of already purchased goods on their shelves. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) producer price index rose to a maximum of 69.8 points since July 2022 in April. According to S&P Global, businesses have already begun to pass on their increased costs to consumers, with the indicator rising to 59.3 points, the highest since August 2022, from 54 points in April. Donald Trump's decisions and statements have also affected the service sector, with preliminary values of indicators showing a decline in tourism activity, including a decline in air ticket sales and hotel bookings. However, in the face of negotiations to ease tariffs with several key US partners, optimism in the sector grew, resulting in a PMI of 52.3 points in services in May, up from 50.8 points in April. The data on the expansion of business activity, combined with the expected acceleration of price growth, has strengthened analysts' confidence that the Fed will not lower interest rates in June or July. The latest statements from the Fed's governing council members also point to this scenario, as they are unanimous in their view that the rate will remain in the current range of 4.25-4.5% per annum for the next few months.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 11:48 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7738631)\n\n**UBS Raises S&P 500 Target to 6,000, Expects 9.6% Increase by Mid-2026**\nUBS has raised its target for the S&P 500 from 5,800 to 6,000 and set a target for June 2026 of 6,400. The change follows better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and expectations of stronger GDP growth in the second half of 2025. The new targets represent a 2.7% increase by the end of the year and a 9.6% increase by mid-2026. David Lefkowitz, CIO of UBS, made the change despite downgrading US stocks from Attractive to Neutral on May 12, after the strong recovery of stocks following the tariff reduction. 'We believe the bull market is intact, and stocks will likely rise even more next year,' Lefkowitz said. 'But the economy will have to adjust to higher tariffs, and that could lead to a period of weaker economic data, which could be a modest obstacle for stocks.' Despite the high valuations, the strategist notes that the index price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is now above 21 times, exceeding its five-year median, signaling potentially stretched valuations. However, the reduction in tariffs across major trading partners as the US enters a negotiation phase suggests that trade-related catalysts for the high market may be diminishing. Nevertheless, there is also the potential for trade tensions to intensify again during these negotiations. Additionally, the economy is expected to experience a period of adjustment to the higher tariffs that remain in place. Lefkowitz observes that, although the economy may face some weakness in the coming months due to these adjustments, they do not foresee a significant risk of a stock market decline, but rather a possible modest obstacle. They maintain that the bull market is still in place and expect stock prices to continue rising next year. Expectations are that economic data will improve in the fourth quarter, driven by real wage growth, fiscal policy clarity, deregulation, and possible rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The conclusion of the first-quarter earnings season also shed light on the continued strength of investment in AI. Companies like Meta increased their capital expenditure plans for 2025, while Microsoft reported exceptional cloud revenue growth and confirmed an increase in capital expenditures for data centers. Industrial and energy companies that serve data centers echoed this positive sentiment. Given a strong earnings season and a slightly more optimistic GDP growth forecast for the second half of the year, analysts revised their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the S&P 500. They increased the EPS forecast for 2025 from $250 to $260, reflecting a 4% growth, and the estimate for 2026 from $275 to $280, a growth of 8%. These adjustments reflect confidence in continued investment spending and the adoption of AI as key drivers of US stock prices.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ubs-eleva-metas-para-o-sp-500-preve-alta-de-cerca-de-10-ate-meados-de-2026-1561451)\n\n**China's Industrial Production Rises, But Consumer Spending Disappoints**\nChina's industrial production grew faster than expected in April, while consumer spending disappointed, highlighting the challenges facing the world's second-largest economy, despite a rapid easing of trade tensions with the US. Industrial production rose 6.1% year-over-year in April, exceeding analysts' expectations (+5.5%), but at a slower pace than the 7.7% in March. This is the largest expansion since June 2021. However, retail sales, a key indicator of consumer spending, grew only 5.1% year-over-year in April, slowing from the previous month's 5.9% and missing the consensus forecast (+5.5%). New home prices in China, measured in the top 70 cities, fell 4% year-over-year in April, but at a slower pace than the 4.5% decline in March. This is the 22nd consecutive month of decline, but the smallest drop since May 2024, as Beijing tries to stabilize the housing market and amid the trade war with the US. Despite the resilience of industries, the weakness in consumer spending in April indicates the need for more favorable policies, despite the 90-day suspension of tariffs. The prolonged Chinese housing crisis, deflationary pressures, and concerns about unemployment are affecting family confidence. Raymond Yeung, chief economist at Greater Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, said, 'The rosy data on industrial production only reflects a part of the economy, but the April retail sales data show that people are not willing to spend. To achieve a 5% growth rate, we still need consumption.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 06:55 AM\nSource:[La Stampa](https://finanza.lastampa.it/News/2025/05/19/cina-calo-consumi-mette-in-secondo-piano-resilienza-fabbriche-pesano-dazi/MTNfMjAyNS0wNS0xOV9UTEI)\n\n**US Industrial Production Remains Stable in April**\nThe industrial production in the United States remained stable in April, according to data released by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on May 15. The index did not change from March, below the market's expectation of a 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, the indicator maintained a positive trend, with a 1.3% increase. However, the performance reflected distinct movements between sectors: while the distribution services sector grew 3.3% in the month, the industrial and mining sectors recorded declines of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The industrial slowdown occurs after the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs by the government of President Donald Trump, which increased commercial tension between Washington and Beijing. The production of durable goods, in particular, receded 1.3% in the month, with a negative highlight for the automotive and steel sectors, heavily impacted by tariffs of 25% on vehicles, parts, steel, and aluminum. Construction and office materials sectors also presented a decline, with falls of 1% and 0.3%, respectively. The overall stability of industrial production contrasts with the expectation of recovery, signaling challenges for the American industry in the face of the commercial scenario. The behavior of the industrial index in April highlights the effects of recent tariff measures and the uncertainties in commercial relations between the United States and China. The uneven sectoral impact indicates that some segments face greater pressure, especially those subject to specific tariff barriers. The maintenance of industrial production at a stable level may influence the Fed's decisions and economic policies for the second half of 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 15, 2025 01:28 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/mundo/producao-industrial-dos-eua-se-mantem-estavel-em-abril/)\n\n**US Employment Data Exceeds Expectations, Boosting Stock Market**\nThe US April employment data exceeded market expectations, leading to a strong close on the New York stock market. The recovery of real economic activity and the improvement of investor sentiment were confirmed, and the possibility of the Federal Reserve (Fed) freezing interest rates also increased. The US Department of Labor announced on May 2 (local time) that the non-agricultural sector employment increased by 177,000 in April, exceeding the experts' forecast (133,000) and the recent 12-month average employment growth rate (152,000). The market focused on this employment report as the first real economic indicator since the tariff policy announced by former President Donald Trump. Despite concerns about economic slowdown, the stronger-than-expected employment growth rate has confirmed the strength of the US labor market. The strong employment data was a boon for the New York stock market, with the Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average rising 564.47 points (1.39%) to 41,317.43, the S&P 500 index rising 82.54 points (1.47%) to 5,686.68, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 266.99 points (1.51%) to 17,977.73. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices have continued their 9-day consecutive rise. The employment growth was led by major private service industries such as healthcare (51,000), transportation and warehousing (29,000), financial activities (14,000), and social support (8,000). However, federal government employment decreased by 9,000, showing the continued trend of public sector restructuring. The bond market also responded strongly. The 10-year US Treasury yield rose to 4.30% as of 9:18 am on May 3, up 9 basis points (0.09 percentage points) from the previous day. This is interpreted as a signal that the labor market is still robust, and the Fed is expected to keep the benchmark rate unchanged for the time being. The probability of the Fed freezing interest rates at the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting increased to 60% from 41.8%. Investors believe that employment is solid but wage growth is slowing, and inflation pressure is not significant. In fact, the average hourly earnings in April rose 0.2% from the previous month, slower than the 0.3% increase in March. The year-over-year growth rate was also 3.8%, lower than the experts' forecast. This can be interpreted as a reason for the Fed not to raise interest rates hastily. Meanwhile, the April unemployment rate was 4.2%, the same as the previous month, and the labor force participation rate improved slightly to 62.6%. This is a positive signal that the population is increasing its participation in the labor market.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: May 03, 2025 11:42 AM\nSource:[\uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\uc2e0\ubb38](https://metroseoul.co.kr/article/20250503500142)\n\n**US Manufacturing Sector Contracts Further in April Amid Tariff Pressures**\nThe US manufacturing sector contracted further in April, as tariffs on imported products continued to pressure supply chains, keeping input prices high. According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the industrial PMI fell to 48.7 in the month, down from 49.0 in March. A PMI below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.2% of the US economy. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted a PMI decline to 48. The survey covered the announcement of tariffs by President Donald Trump, which led to widespread tariffs on imports from US trade partners, including a 145% tariff on Chinese products, sparking a trade war with Beijing. The manufacturing industry relies heavily on imported raw materials. The second consecutive monthly decline in PMI ended a brief recovery in the industry, driven by hopes of a less stringent regulatory environment under the Trump administration and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There were no signs in the survey that factories continued to anticipate imports in the month, although the fear of higher prices due to tariffs may have led companies to anticipate orders. A surge in imports weighed on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter. The sub-index of new prospective orders in the ISM survey improved to 47.2, after falling to 45.2 in March - the lowest reading since May 2023. Factory production remained depressed and supplier delivery performance worsened in the month. The supplier delivery index in the survey rose to 55.2 in April, from 53.5 in March. In this case, a reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With the slowdown in deliveries, the measure of the survey on prices paid by manufacturers for inputs rose to 69.8, the highest level since June 2022, from 69.4 in March, indicating a recovery in product prices, which had fallen in March. Factories continued to cut jobs, although the pace slowed.

Factory production remained depressed and supplier delivery performance worsened in the month. The supplier delivery index in the survey rose from 53.5 in March to 55.2 in April. In this case, a reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With the slowdown in deliveries, the measure of the survey on prices paid by manufacturers for inputs rose to 69.8, the highest level since June 2022, up from 69.4 in March, indicating a recovery in product prices that had fallen in March. Factories continued to cut jobs, although the pace slowed. The employment measure in the industry survey rose from 44.7 in March to 46.5.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 01, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/queda-no-setor-manufatureiro-dos-eua-se-aprofunda-em-abril,d887d3b1505c8c272d9cf870d33c54b7n05yn3o0.html)\n\n**US Manufacturing Indices Plummet Amid Trump's Tariffs**\nDespite President Trump's emphasis on manufacturing growth, the US's major 5 regions' manufacturing indices have all recorded negative numbers. The Dallas Federal Reserve reported that the 4-month manufacturing index for the southern state of Texas, which accounts for 10% of the country's GDP, plummeted from -16.3 in March to -35.8 in April, the lowest level since May 2020. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported a decline from 12.5 in March to -26.4 in April, while the Kansas City Federal Reserve reported a decline from -2 to -4, and the Richmond Federal Reserve reported a decline from -4 to -13. Although the New York Federal Reserve reported a slight increase, its manufacturing index of -8.1 still resulted in all 5 major regions' manufacturing indices recording negative numbers. Economists attribute this to Trump's uncertain tariffs, which have caused investors to shy away from manufacturing investments, and the disruption of global supply chains. They note that reviving US manufacturing jobs through tariffs is unlikely to be realistic.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: April 28, 2025 10:09 PM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0104_202504290709193672)\n\n**US Economy Already Sputtering Before Trade Pain Hit: Eco Week**\nThe US economy has been slowing down since the beginning of 2025, despite having a strong performance for most of last year. The main factors behind this slowdown are the increase in imports due to tariff policies, the expansion of trade deficits, and a decrease in consumer purchasing power. The Commerce Department is expected to release the 1-3 month (first quarter) GDP growth rate on April 30, which is predicted to be 0.4% year-over-year, a nearly 3-year low. Ana Wong, chief US economist at Bloomberg Economics, said, 'The real GDP growth rate is expected to decrease from 2.4% in the 4th quarter of 2024 to 0.4% in the 1st quarter of 2025, with trade deficits being the main negative factor. Companies have been stockpiling imports in anticipation of Trump's tariff increases, and consumers have been buying certain goods, such as cars, in anticipation of price increases due to tariffs. However, overall, they are still being cautious.' The upcoming economic indicators, including the personal income and expenditure statistics for March, will be closely watched. Economists predict that March's expenditure will show a healthy growth, while income will slow down. The core price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, is expected to show a 2.6% increase from the same period last year, the lowest growth since June last year.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: April 27, 2025 12:16 PM\nSource:[goo blog](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/spc101c/e/9392de8699d8b9dc2f09b0a16dc748d5)\n\n**US Manufacturing Sector Contracts for First Time This Year Amid Trump Tariff Policy**\nThe US manufacturing sector contracted for the first time this year in March, with the ISM manufacturing index falling to 49.0, below the 50 threshold. This is a result of the Trump administration's tariff policy, which has increased uncertainty in the market. The ISM noted that despite the initial rebound in manufacturing at the beginning of the year, the tariff policy has severely impacted this trend. The data showed that the new orders index fell to 45.2, the lowest since May 2023, indicating a significant decrease in demand. As a result, production declined, leading to the first contraction in factory output this year. The employment index also fell to 44.7, a new low since September last year, indicating that companies are further reducing staff, reflecting the difficulties faced by the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, the factory materials price index rose to 69.4, up 7 points from February, a new high since June 2022, indicating that material prices are rising and that inflationary pressures may continue to rise, pushing overall price levels higher. As companies accelerate imports to avoid upcoming tariffs, the ISM's import index has declined, showing that companies' demand for foreign goods has begun to stabilize. The supplier delivery index also fell from 54.5 in February to 53.5, indicating a slight slowdown in delivery speeds. This change reflects the reduction in imports due to tariff uncertainty and the risk of supply chain disruptions. As the tariff policy intensifies, economists have become increasingly pessimistic about the US economy's future growth prospects. Goldman Sachs economists have adjusted their recession probability, predicting a 35% chance of recession in the next 12 months, up from 20% previously. The sudden decline in business and consumer confidence has made the market even more anxious about the future economic outlook. The Federal Reserve has paused interest rate cuts in January and is closely monitoring the impact of the tariff policy on economic activity. Although some industries, such as oil, coal, and metal manufacturing, have shown growth, the overall manufacturing sector is facing double pressure from domestic and foreign uncertainty. Companies' delay in investment plans, supply chain disruptions, and the cost increase brought by tariffs may further drag down the US manufacturing recovery.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 01, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This is a stronger decline than expected, with economists forecasting a drop to 49.5 points. The ISM Index has fallen below the growth threshold of 50 points, indicating a contraction in economic activity. According to Ulrich Wortberg, economist at Landesbank Hessen-Th\u00fcringen, 'The volatile US policy, which has introduced and increased tariffs on many trading partners, is likely to blame for the decline.' Wortberg also notes that growth concerns are increasing, but it is uncertain whether the US Federal Reserve will feel pressured to loosen monetary policy quickly, given the risks of inflation. The sub-indicators for new orders and employment both fell below the growth threshold, while the prices paid index rose significantly, reaching its highest level since June 2022.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: April 01, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/aktien/usa-ism-einkaufsmanagerindex-fuer-die-industrie-sinkt-staerker-als-erwartet-14360734)\n\n**European Stock Markets in Positive Trend Amid Global Economic Uncertainty**\nEuropean stock markets are in a positive trend, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index rising 0.5% to 550.24, the DAX 40 index in Germany increasing 1.1% to 22,379, and the FTSE 100 index in the UK falling 0.4% to 8,769.65. The MIB 30 index in Italy rose 0.3% to 37,658, the IBEX 35 index in Spain gained 0.2% to 12,932.36, and the CAC 40 index in France increased 0.9% to 8,112.67. Global markets are experiencing a mixed trend following the release of inflation data in the US and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Attention is now focused on the release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) today. Meanwhile, European Union Council President Antonio Costa suggested that instead of imposing tariffs in response to US President Donald Trump's comments on additional tariffs, a more beneficial agreement would be reached. Today's data releases in the region show that Germany's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January decreased by 0.2% on a monthly basis, while increasing by 2.3% on a yearly basis. The UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter exceeded expectations, rising 0.1% from the previous quarter and 1.4% on a yearly basis. Additionally, the UK's industrial production for December increased by 0.5% on a monthly basis, exceeding expectations. Today's data releases will include weekly unemployment claims and the PPI in the US, as well as industrial production in the Eurozone.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 09:52 AM\nSource:[Milliyet](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/uzmanpara/avrupa-borsalari-pozitif-seyirde-7306612)\n\n**US Industrial Activity Expands in January for First Time in Over Two Years**\nThe US industrial activity grew for the first time in over two years in January, due to strong order numbers, but a measure of the prices paid by factories for raw materials increased, and higher ones are likely after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products over the weekend. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that its manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9 last month, the highest reading since September 2022, from 49.2 in December. This was the first time since October 2022 that the PMI rose above the 50 mark, indicating growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy. Economists consulted by Reuters had predicted a PMI of 49.8. The recovery, likely driven in part by hopes of tax cuts, may be short-lived, as tariffs are expected to increase raw material costs and disrupt supply chains. Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, which are set to take effect on Tuesday. Manufacturing was hurt by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to control inflation. The US central bank began its cycle of monetary easing in September, reducing rates by 100 basis points before pausing in January due to uncertainty over the economic impact of government policies. The ISM's new orders subindex jumped from 52.1 in December to 55.1 last month. Factory production also increased. The price measure paid by manufacturers reached an eight-month high of 54.9, from 52.5 in December. Imports grew, suggesting that manufacturers were stocking up on materials before the tariffs. Factory employment expanded for the first time since May, with the employment index in the sector recovering to 50.3, compared to 45.4 in December, according to ISM's Tom Moeller, who said, 'The employment index is a good indicator of the overall health of the manufacturing sector.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/atividade-industrial-dos-eua-se-expande-em-janeiro-pela-1-vez-desde-2022-mostra-ism,1c58febc148ced4bb454598688ec8841cvg20g65.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts are divided, but the consensus slightly favors a positive year-over-year growth for US industrial production in May 2025, though with substantial downside risk. All experts note that April 2025 saw +1.49% YoY growth, driven primarily by an energy sector (oil extraction/processing) surge and a calendar effect (an extra working day). Most are skeptical that these boosts will repeat in May; several expect the calendar tailwind to vanish and oil output to plateau or pull back.\n\nKey negative factors cited include contractionary manufacturing indices (ISM, regional Fed surveys), deteriorating global manufacturing (especially in China and South Korea), ongoing or intensifying tariff/trade disruptions, and sector-wide weakness outside of energy and select tech. Regional and sectoral analyses emphasize that broad-based US manufacturing is in contraction, and that risks of a dip to 0% or negative YoY growth\u2014though still modest by historical base rates\u2014are elevated by policy headwinds and soft demand.\n\nOn the positive side, several forecasters highlight resilience in energy, emerging tech sectors (AI, electronics), strong equity markets, and a still-solid labor market, which could cushion the industrial downturn or keep the YoY print just positive by inertia or base effects.\n\nProbabilities provided by experts range from 35% to 75% for a positive YoY outcome in May, with most in the 58\u201375% band, a few (especially regional and IO-focused) seeing sub-40% odds. Scenarios for a No outcome generally require both the energy sector to falter and negative manufacturing trends to fully translate into hard output data. Yes scenarios assume ongoing strength or only modest retrace in energy/tech, and sufficient economic momentum to offset sectoral and policy weakness.\n\nSumming up, most forecasters expect a narrow positive YoY print for May 2025, albeit with substantial risk of a zero or slightly negative outcome if the April gains prove flukes. The median probability estimate lies around 60\u201365%, reflecting a cautious but modestly optimistic consensus."
