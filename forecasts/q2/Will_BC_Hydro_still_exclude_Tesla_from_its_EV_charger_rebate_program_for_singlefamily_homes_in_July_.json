Furthermore, the recentness and clarity of the policy make a rapid reversal very unlikely, especially given the alignment with provincial efforts to support Canadian goods.

My critique of the 97% camp highlighted that, while base rates and inertia dominate, there's a sliver of unpredictability in provincial-federal dynamics and potential for political maneuver. On the other end, the technology adoption and administrative inertia perspectives tend to slightly underplay the top-down political mandate. Given all this, my original probability (92%) already reflects a very high confidence in persistence of the status quo, accounting for these tail scenarios. Therefore, after comparing both the arguments for maximal confidence and those for humility in the face of political volatility, I affirm my original forecast: 92% remains the best-calibrated stance.",

According to Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, the decline is not solely due to a general dislike of Elon Musk, but also due to tariffs and rebate cutbacks. The federal EV rebate program ended on March 31, and Quebec's program was paused between Feb. 1 and April 1, making it difficult for buyers to stack rebates. Breton believes that more fulsome data will show that Tesla isn't the only EV maker to take a hit in Quebec's market. The 25% tariff on U.S.-made EVs, including Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid cars, imposed by the federal government, is also hurting sales. 'Now that the [Quebec] rebate is back, we'll see what happens with the sales of EVs in general and Tesla in particular,' said Breton. 'I'm really disappointed in what Elon Musk has been doing for the past year or two. So I hope that they find a way to resolve this,' he added.

McCutcheon said, 'President Trump, Elon Musk and the other oligarchs are dismantling democracy down there at a rapid rate.' The protesters waved the Canadian flag and held signs that read 'Elon + Musk = Evil' and 'Musk can go to Mars, we don't need his Swasticars.' While some drivers showed support by honking their horns, at least one driver displayed opposition. McCutcheon defended the driver's right to protest, saying, 'It's a free country.

In contrast, Tesla's registrations in Quebec, Canada's largest EV market, dropped by 90% from 5,097 in Q4 2024 to 524 in Q1 2025. The decline is attributed to the Canadian government's halt of the iZEV rebate program and Quebec's regional incentive program. Additionally, Elon Musk's comment that 'Canada is not a real country' has likely contributed to the decline in Tesla's popularity among Canadians.

Power**\nAccording to J.D. Power's 2025 Canada Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study, the percentage of new vehicle buyers in Canada who are 'very likely' or 'likely' to consider an electric vehicle (EV) has remained stable at 28%, despite the suspension of the country's iVZE incentive program. However, this stability masks significant changes in the underlying market dynamics. Nearly half (42%) of potential EV buyers say that the program's suspension would negatively affect their likelihood of purchasing an EV. In Quebec, where the incentives were temporarily suspended in February and March 2025, consideration decreased by 8 percentage points, while it increased by 2 points in the rest of Canada. The study also notes a significant shift in the top EV brands considered by consumers. 'Despite a high level of volatility in the EV market, the overall interest of consumers in EVs at a higher level remains largely unchanged this year,' says J.D. Ney, director of automotive service, J.D. Power Canada. 'What is remarkable, however, is the reaction to the incentive ecosystem, and perhaps for manufacturers in particular, which translates to a shift in consumer interest towards traditional brands. Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet are now the top five brands considered by new vehicle buyers who are 'very likely' or 'likely' to consider an EV. Tesla, which was among the top two EV brands considered in the study over the past four years, has fallen to eighth place among likely EV buyers, down 16 percentage points from last year, while the average gain for all other brands combined is half a percentage point.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250529550969/fr)\n\n**VinFast VF 8 Offers Rare Value in 2025 with Provincial Incentives**\nAs federal incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) have been eliminated and Quebec is offering up to $4,000 in 2025, Canadians considering purchasing EVs, such as the VinFast VF 8, face a narrowing window of opportunity, but still a lucrative one, as provincial incentives tighten and the market shifts towards a long-term policy.

According to the California New Car Dealers Association's 2025 Auto Outlook Report, just 20.8% of new cars were zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Q1 2025, a decline from 22% in 2024. Robb Hernandez, the association's chairman, said, 'Dealers sell what customers want to buy. No mandate can force consumers to choose otherwise.' Tesla's market share decreased to 43.9% in Q1 2025, down from 55.5% in Q1 2024, due to declining registrations. The state's expired EV tax credit, which excluded Tesla, has not been extended.

This move comes amid rising US tariffs on Canadian products and declining Tesla shares, which have dropped by approximately 45% in 2025. The decision applies to Tesla charging products, including EV chargers, inverters, and the Powerwall home battery, but those who have purchased or received pre-approval for these products prior to March 12 will still qualify for the rebate. As reported by bchydro.com, this decision is not directly related to the recent protests against CEO Elon Musk's role in the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, it is worth noting that President Trump recently showed support for Musk's company by announcing he was buying a Tesla outside of the White House.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[electrive.com](https://www.electrive.com/2025/03/15/tesla-no-longer-eligible-for-rebates-in-parts-of-canada/)\n\n**Province set sights on Tesla in latest response to US Tariffs - My East Kootenay Now**\nThe British Columbia government is taking action against Tesla, owned by Elon Musk, in response to US tariffs on Canadian goods.

    "date": "2025-05-30T14:19:48.149911",
    "summary": "All forecasting experts converge on a very high probability that BC Hydro will continue to exclude Tesla products from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025. This consensus is built on several shared factors: the exclusion is a recent, explicit response to ongoing US-Canada trade tensions and tariffs, meant to preference Canadian goods and signal political and economic retaliation. Experts point to strong bureaucratic inertia and administrative path dependence within such government-backed rebate programs, with policy reversals within months considered rare\u2014especially in the absence of major developments like a sudden trade breakthrough, legal challenge, or significant public backlash. Experts also highlight the further entrenchment of the policy by negative political and public sentiment toward Tesla and Elon Musk, declining Tesla sales, and the political optics surrounding local industry support. The availability of alternative charger brands, lack of consumer uproar over the exclusion, and no evident legal or trade challenge further reduce the likelihood of a reversal. The only plausible pathway to a No outcome\u2014a rapid, public detente in US-Canada trade relations or strong legal/political intervention\u2014is seen as improbable within the short window before July 2025. Probabilities assigned by experts for continued exclusion range between 90% and 97%, underscoring broad agreement that the status quo will most likely persist at the resolution date."
