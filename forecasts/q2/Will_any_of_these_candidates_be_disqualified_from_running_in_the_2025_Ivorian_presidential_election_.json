There is intense scrutiny on opposition figures as potential legal pretexts for last-minute exclusion remain plausible\u2014most notably around party eligibility (e.g., infighting within PDCI potentially exposing Billon), criminal cases, or even administrative challenges. However, for remaining figures, no immediate legal move is in the works per the latest reporting (as of May 29-30, 2025), and candidate list finalizations are near closure. Given the government\u2019s recent history, the risk remains non-negligible but is unlikely to affect a majority of the named candidates. Taking all factors\u2014especially the regime's willingness for exclusion, slow but notable international scrutiny, and pending legal windows\u2014a probability at the high end of the plausible range is justified. Factoring in both the strong propensity for exclusion shown recently and the near-finalization of lists, I judge a 70% chance that at least one of the listed candidates (apart from those already ineligible as of the forecast date) will be disqualified before July 1, 2025.",

Moreover, the government has not hesitated to use the judiciary and electoral administration to prevent rivals from contesting. Domestic and international resistance to exclusions has modestly increased\u2014yet, the authorities\u2019 incentives to keep strong challengers out remain high, and the legal tools to do so are accessible and already in use. The risk is particularly acute for Laurent Gbagbo and possibly Simone Gbagbo; Jean-Louis Billon could also be targeted if intra-party disputes escalate or new legal challenges emerge. With just over a month to go\u2014and a final electoral list not yet closed\u2014there remains substantial time and political motive for at least one further exclusion.

The judicial and administrative environment is openly adversarial to the opposition, with few effective recourses. Precedent is strong, with most prior elections in the last decade seeing the disqualification of major opposition figures on technical grounds. The recent removal of Tidjane Thiam, and references to Gbagbo's ineligibility, reinforce that the threat is current, not hypothetical. However, Jean-Louis Billon remains vigorously active, and the authorities may feel pressured to preserve at least a thin veil of competition, especially under international watch and after recent opposition mobilization. Weighing these factors, it is highly probable\u2014not quite certain, but upwards of 80%\u2014that at least one of the remaining named candidates is officially confirmed as disqualified by July 1, 2025. The remaining scenario for 'No' is narrow and would require a substantial shift in regime calculus or an unexpected legal reprieve.

The base rate for disqualifying serious opposition figures just before the official candidate deadline is high in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, especially where the opposition is fragmented and the regime sees electoral exclusion as a viable means to manage competition. Given the technical legal tools available, the willingness to use them, recent court decisions, and the stated intention to exclude 'four main opposition leaders' per the government narrative, a further disqualification before July 1 is quite possible.

However, a number of the most likely exclusions (Gbagbo, Thiam) have already occurred or are practically locked in. Among the remainder, the most probable targets for new exclusion are Jean-Louis Billon (if he emerges as the main opposition figure for PDCI) and, to a lesser degree, Simone Gbagbo (given her history and the regime's tendency to restrict prominent Gbagbo family members). The main argument against further disqualification is that the regime may feel secure enough and international attention is relatively sleepy, which could favor allowing a controlled opposition to participate. Nevertheless, the presence of unaddressed legal vulnerabilities and regime paranoia suggest a significant risk remains. I therefore assess the probability at 35%, higher than a mere actuarial base rate for a random peaceful African democracy, but lower than in previous cycles because of the relatively advanced nature of current exclusions and the relatively low threat level posed by the remaining listed candidates.",

My critique of the low 27% forecast by 'Elite Theory' only sharpened this position: such caution ignores both base rates and the ongoing, real-time exclusionary moves already playing out. The only minor new consideration is the possibility that the regime might feel it has already neutralized the top-tier threats, which could slightly dampen risk for the lower-profile names.

As noted by several high-confidence forecasters, the elimination of Laurent Gbagbo is not just likely but already all but confirmed, and the window/incentive for further technical exclusions persists.

Notably, colleagues from election administration, human rights, and African studies backgrounds\u2014who regularly track the on-the-ground mechanics of West African elections\u2014pushed back on my notion that a reduced threat and time constraint sharply lower further exclusion risk. They emphasized: (1) the exclusion pattern often clusters late with regimes unafraid to make last-minute legal moves; (2) the remaining opposition (Billon, Simone Gbagbo, etc.) is not too weak to be ignored, as exclusion serves signaling, not just threat elimination; (3) international pressure and 'regime legitimacy' concerns have little precedent in deterring the Ivorian ruling circle; (4) the legal and institutional machinery for exclusion is already fully spun up. I am now convinced my original model underweighted these factors, and that\u2014consistent with regional authoritarian management and Ivorian precedent\u2014the probability of at least one more of the specified candidates being (remaining) disqualified before July 1 is much higher.

Lower estimates were widely\u2014and correctly\u2014criticized for underweighting the mechanics of managed electoral exclusion. The most compelling argument to revise up is the strong consensus around the fate of Gbagbo: credible sources recognize him as de facto excluded, and the final candidate list (due June 20) or legal clarification is highly likely to codify this, easily meeting resolution criteria.

If anything, the group discussions clarified that the window for further exclusions does not meaningfully close until the final candidate list is published, and that even non-front-runner candidates remain viable targets.

The regime's history of last-minute legal maneuvering, the technical nature of Gbagbo's exclusion (requiring a presidential pardon which has not materialized), and the timing of the final electoral list all point to at least one candidate being excluded in a manner that meets the resolution criteria.

My own view, reinforced by the arguments presented, still holds: base rates and current legal patterns make further exclusions likely, but not a certainty bordering on 100%. While some forecasters credibly detail the near \u2018fait accompli\u2019 status for Laurent Gbagbo, there is legitimate debate as to whether new disqualifications among Billon or Simone Gbagbo are imminent, or whether the regime will pause after turfing the most dangerous rivals. The strongest critique of my initial range challenges excessive pessimism (e.g., 97%) as failing to account for diminishing returns after major players are axed.

The election marks the end of Dr Akinwumi Adesina's two-term presidency tenure, which ends in September 2025.

He criticized the party's current leadership, led by Tidjane Thiam, who was disqualified from the election due to his dual nationality. Billon called for a new convention to choose a legitimate candidate and emphasized the importance of unity within the party. He also rejected the idea of revising the electoral list, saying 'we must participate in the elections.' Billon plans to tour the country to listen to the people and share his vision for a 'more just, equitable, and solidary' C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.

In the ruling RHDP party, President Alassane Ouattara has yet to announce his candidacy or nominate a successor. Meanwhile, the opposition parties are waiting for the fate of their leaders, who have been disqualified due to judicial convictions. Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, Laurent Gbagbo, and Guillaume Soro are among those excluded from the electoral process. In response, the PDCI-RDA party, led by Tidjane Thiam, has been trying to maintain its position. However, Thiam's own fate remains uncertain due to his dual nationality, which has led to a series of judicial challenges. Despite being re-elected as party president with over 99% of the vote, Thiam's absence from the country has raised questions about his strategy. Jean-Louis Billon, a dissident within the PDCI-RDA, has emerged as a potential alternative candidate, criticizing Thiam's leadership and calling for a new candidate to be chosen. Billon has announced his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election, saying, 'If I am not heard, I will advance. I will bring victory to the PDCI.' He has also outlined a program, focusing on reducing the number of institutions in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and promoting national actors in the economy.

Videos and messages, mainly in English, claimed that President Alassane Ouattara had been overthrown and that major unrest was sweeping Abidjan. However, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) quickly denied these allegations, calling them 'false and totally unfounded', and highlighting that they resulted from a 'deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign'. The Ivorian authorities have called on the population to be vigilant and to refer only to official sources for information. No tangible evidence has been provided to support these rumors, and no major incidents have been reported on the ground. A tense political climate is approaching the elections The Ivorian political context is marked by growing tensions as the presidential election approaches. The potential candidacy of outgoing President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term has sparked controversy. The 2016 Ivorian Constitution limits the number of presidential terms to two, but Ouattara was re-elected for a third term in 2020, invoking that the new Constitution reset the term counter. Furthermore, opposition leader Tidjane Thiam, a prominent figure of the Democratic Party of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), was disqualified from the presidential race in April 2025 due to his dual French-Ivorian nationality. Although he renounced his French nationality in February 2025, the justice deemed that he did not meet the eligibility conditions at the time of his registration on the electoral lists. Contested candidacies and a fragmented opposition In addition to Tidjane Thiam, other major political figures are at the heart of the debates. Laurent Gbagbo, former president, has been designated as a candidate by his party despite his current ineligibility. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Vincent Toh Bi Iri\u00e9, former prefect of Abidjan, is running as an independent, while Jean-Louis Billon, former minister, has confirmed his candidacy. This multiplicity of candidacies, often from the opposition, reflects a political fragmentation that could complicate the formation of a united alternative to the ruling power. Calls for calm and initiatives for peace In the face of these tensions, initiatives aimed at promoting peace and social cohesion are multiplying. On May 24, 2025, an interconfessional conference was held in Abidjan, bringing together Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote non-violence and national unity ahead of the elections. On the other hand, the UN, through its special envoy for West Africa and the Sahel, Leonardo Santos Sim\u00e3o, met with the main Ivorian political actors in April 2025 to urge them to prioritize dialogue and avoid any escalation of violence. Thus, as the 2025 presidential election approaches, vigilance, respect for institutions, and dialogue between the different stakeholders will be essential to ensure a peaceful and transparent election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[tunisienumerique.com](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/vers-un-nouveau-cycle-de-violence-electorale-en-cote-divoire/)\n\n**PDCI Militants March in Support of Cheick Tidjane Thiam**\nHundreds of militants from the Ivorian Democratic Party (PDCI), including elected officials and local political leaders, marched in Gagnoa on May 28, 2025, to protest the removal of Cheick Tidjane Thiam from the electoral list.

Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, Laurent Gbagbo, and Guillaume Soro are among those excluded from the electoral process. In response, the PDCI-RDA party, led by Tidjane Thiam, has been trying to maintain its position. However, Thiam's own fate remains uncertain due to his dual nationality, which has led to a series of judicial challenges. Despite being re-elected as party president with over 99% of the vote, Thiam's absence from the country has raised questions about his strategy. Jean-Louis Billon, a dissident within the PDCI-RDA, has emerged as a potential alternative candidate, criticizing Thiam's leadership and calling for a new candidate to be chosen. Billon has announced his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election, saying, 'If I am not heard, I will advance. I will bring victory to the PDCI.'

The Projet de D\u00e9veloppement des cha\u00eenes de valeur vivri\u00e8res (Pdc2v) and the Agence emploi jeunes (Aej) have signed a partnership agreement to facilitate access to financing for 200 young agricultural entrepreneurs. The Pdc2v, which already subsidizes 80-90% of agricultural projects, requires a personal contribution of 10-20% from beneficiaries. The Aej will now cover this remaining portion through adapted loans, allowing young project leaders to pursue their ambitions. As stated by the Minister of State, Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani, 'It was not enough to give 80 or 90%. We needed to find a solution for the rest.' The Pdc2v is currently deployed in 14 regions and aims to build inclusive, competitive, and sustainable value chains in the agricultural sector, promoting modern and opportunity-generating agriculture. Meanwhile, the Programme de transformation strat\u00e9gique de l'aquaculture en C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Pstaci) plans to establish 20 fish farms in Abidjan, Agboville, Dabou, Bouak\u00e9, Korhogo, Man, and Tiapoum, inserting 60 young people into the tilapia fishery. With a production target of 500,000 tonnes of fish by 2030 and a value chain estimated at 825 billion CFA francs, the Pstaci aims to reduce imports, achieve food self-sufficiency, and stimulate the creation of sustainable jobs, particularly for young people and women.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 10:25 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/lutte-contre-le-chomage-le-pdc2v-et-laej-en-action)\n\n**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**\nAs the presidential election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire approaches on October 25, 2025, the country is plagued by rumors of a coup spread on social media. Videos and messages, mainly in English, claimed that President Alassane Ouattara had been overthrown and that major unrest was sweeping Abidjan. However, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) quickly denied these allegations, calling them 'false and totally unfounded', and highlighting that they resulted from a 'deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign'. The Ivorian authorities have called on the population to be vigilant and to refer only to official sources for information. No tangible evidence has been provided to support these rumors, and no major incidents have been reported on the ground. A tense political climate is approaching the elections The Ivorian political context is marked by growing tensions as the presidential election approaches. The potential candidacy of outgoing President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term has sparked controversy. The 2016 Ivorian Constitution limits the number of presidential terms to two, but Ouattara was re-elected for a third term in 2020, invoking that the new Constitution reset the term counter. Furthermore, opposition leader Tidjane Thiam, a prominent figure of the Democratic Party of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), was disqualified from the presidential race in April 2025 due to his dual French-Ivorian nationality. Although he renounced his French nationality in February 2025, the justice deemed that he did not meet the eligibility conditions at the time of his registration on the electoral lists. Contested candidacies and a fragmented opposition In addition to Tidjane Thiam, other major political figures are at the heart of the debates. Laurent Gbagbo, former president, has been designated as a candidate by his party despite his current ineligibility. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Vincent Toh Bi Iri\u00e9, former prefect of Abidjan, is running as an independent, while Jean-Louis Billon, former minister, has confirmed his candidacy. This multiplicity of candidacies, often from the opposition, reflects a political fragmentation that could complicate the formation of a united alternative to the ruling power. Calls for calm and initiatives for peace In the face of these tensions, initiatives aimed at promoting peace and social cohesion are multiplying. On May 24, 2025, an interconfessional conference was held in Abidjan, bringing together Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote non-violence and national unity ahead of the elections. On the other hand, the UN, through its special envoy for West Africa and the Sahel, Leonardo Santos Sim\u00e3o, met with the main Ivorian political actors in April 2025 to urge them to prioritize dialogue and avoid any escalation of violence. Thus, as the 2025 presidential election approaches, vigilance, respect for institutions, and dialogue between the different stakeholders will be essential to ensure a peaceful and transparent election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[tunisienumerique.com](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/vers-un-nouveau-cycle-de-violence-electorale-en-cote-divoire/)\n\n**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**\nIvory Coast is facing a tense political climate ahead of the presidential election on October 25, 2025.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding Thiam's candidacy, the electoral law has confirmed that the period of contestation is closed since April 20, 2025. Many observers are advocating for a return to the CEDEAO text, which allows for a consensus between actors to make changes to the electoral law, including a postponement, within the 6-month period preceding the election. However, with the positions of the ruling party and the oppositions being fixed, a compromise is needed to find a political solution to the crisis. The decision of the Abidjan court, made on May 22, 2025, seems to offer little guidance on the way forward. The court ruled that the PDCI-RDA's decision to remove Thiam from the party's leadership was legitimate, and that he should not be considered as the party's candidate. The question remains whether the Ivorian politicians will learn from this decision and find a way to resolve their differences. 'Resolve your political disputes according to your party's internal texts before coming to me,' the judge said, closing the case on Thiam's legitimacy and the decisions taken by the PDCI. The situation remains uncertain, with the PDCI-RDA and the RHDP engaging in a game of cat and mouse, each managing their internal crises and waiting for the outcome of the judicial and political process.

The opposition, led by the PDCI-RDA and the PPA-CI of Laurent Gbagbo, has announced its withdrawal from the CEI, breaking one of the founding commitments of the commission to represent the entire Ivorian political landscape.

The COJEP is also demanding the reintegration of Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9: 'we launch this appeal: restore the rights of President Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, reintegrate him on the electoral list to allow him to participate in the 2025 election,' said Me Serge Ouraga, COJEP spokesperson. Gbagbo and Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9 were sentenced to 20 years in prison for their roles in the 2010-2011 post-electoral crisis, but were amnestied by international justice. However, without a pardon from President Alassane Ouattara, they cannot be re-registered on the electoral list. The ruling RHDP party believes the opposition is trying to delay the electoral process to make the October 25 election impossible, according to Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani, RHDP spokesperson.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[Africanews](https://fr.africanews.com/2025/03/20/gbagbo-et-ble-goude-les-grands-absents-dune-liste-electorale-controversee/)\n\n**Gbagbo Announces Presidential Bid, Calls for Independent Electoral Commission**\nLaurent Gbagbo, a 79-year-old Ivorian politician, has announced that he will run for president in the upcoming election, despite being currently ineligible due to a conviction related to the 2010-2011 post-electoral crisis. Gbagbo has outlined several conditions for a peaceful election, including the establishment of an independent electoral commission, a revision of the electoral rolls to ensure only Ivorian citizens are registered, and a democratic debate without repression. He also criticized the current electoral commission for being 'inf\u00e9od\u00e9e' to President Alassane Ouattara. Gbagbo's party, the Parti des peuples ivoiriens - C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), has accused the government of conducting 'proc\u00e8s politiques' against its leaders, who are facing trial for alleged crimes. Gbagbo said, 'If we want an election in peace and tranquility, we must stop repressing those who have a different point of view from those in power.' Several other candidates, including Tidjane Thiam, Jean-Louis Billon, and Pascal Affi N'Guessan, have also announced their candidacy for the October 25, 2025 presidential election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[Le360 Afrique](https://afrique.le360.ma/politique/cote-divoire-gbagbo-veut-se-battre-pour-une-presidentielle-juste_O6SZEXPAZBFB3K2OXKWC3LC6YE/)\n\n**C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: Opposition Leader Tidjane Thiam Renounces French Nationality to Run for President**\nTidjane Thiam, the president of the Parti d\u00e9mocratique de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), has announced that he will renounce his French nationality to be eligible for the upcoming presidential election in October 2025. 'We have made an important step today (...) that we had planned for a long time, which consisted of going to deposit my request for the release of my French nationality, which will allow me to be exclusively Ivorian at the time of the election,' Thiam said. 'It's an administrative formality,' he added. According to Article 55 of the Ivorian Constitution, a presidential candidate must be 'exclusively of Ivorian nationality, born of an Ivorian father or mother.' Thiam, a former engineer, minister, and bank executive, lived outside of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for 20 years before returning in August 2022. He became the president of the PDCI in December 2023 and will be designated as the party's candidate at a convention whose date has yet to be determined. He may face Jean-Louis Billon, a former minister of Commerce who has already announced his candidacy and opposes Thiam. Several other candidates, including former President Laurent Gbagbo, his ex-wife Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, and former Prime Minister Pascal Affi N'Guessan, have also announced their candidacy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 06:34 PM\nSource:[lefigaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/cote-d-ivoire-l-opposant-tidjane-thiam-renonce-a-sa-nationalite-francaise-20250207)\n\n**C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Presidential Election 2025: Key Players and Debates**\nThe national news in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on February 5, 2025, is dominated by political topics, particularly the debates surrounding the upcoming presidential election in October. According to L'Expression, the two main opponents of the RHDP are Ciss\u00e9 Bacongo and an unnamed second opponent. Le Matin criticizes the opposition for trying to discredit the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI). Le Patriote quotes Ciss\u00e9 Bacongo, saying that President Alassane Ouattara 'deserves to continue' and that the opposition's goal is to elect the president in the first round. Le Jour plus states that Ouattara is the favorite to win the election, citing reasons why Ivorians support him. L'Avenir presents alternative candidates for the PDCI and PPA-CI, who are reportedly out of the running for the election. Le B\u00e9lier suggests that Ouattara is seeking international support for a fourth term. Le Nouveau R\u00e9veil argues that Ouattara's fourth term is a big equation and a big concern. Derni\u00e8re Heure Monde claims that Tidjane Thiam cannot be disqualified from the election, despite opposition from some groups. Le Quotidien d'Abidjan states that a 'big mission' has been given to Laurent Gbagbo in the context of the election, and Le Canard d\u00e9cha\u00een\u00e9 suggests that Gbagbo will be a candidate in the election. Kon\u00e9 Daouda explains why he has chosen to support Pascal Affi N'guessan, the president of the FPI. L'Inter reports that former demobilized soldiers have called on Ouattara, Gbagbo, and Thiam to preserve peace in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire during the election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 07:43 AM\nSource:[aip.ci](https://www.aip.ci/152144/cote-divoire-aip-revue-de-presse-les-sujets-politiques-dominent-lactualite-nationale-de-ce-mercredi-5-fevrier-2025/)\n\n**Affi N'Guessan Calls on Laurent Gbagbo to Unite Opposition Ahead of 2025 Presidential Election**\nPascal Affi N'Guessan, president of the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), has called on Laurent Gbagbo, former president of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, to unite the opposition ahead of the 2025 presidential election. In a speech, Affi N'Guessan denounced the fragmentation of the opposition and urged its leaders to put aside personal interests for the sake of democratic alternance. 'The responsibility of the opposition is immense at this moment in our country's history. The time must not be one of personal and egoistic calculations. Our people are unhappy with our divisions, with the image we project, of a fragmented and paralyzed opposition, unable to fight together for the only essential combat: that of democratic alternance,' he said. Affi N'Guessan also called for a sincere dialogue between the opposition and the ruling power, as a guarantee of inclusive, free, and transparent elections. He invited Laurent Gbagbo to take on a unifying role, recalling that the late Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 had brought the opposition together against Alassane Ouattara's third term. 'Following the Bonoua Appeal, President Laurent Gbagbo must now work towards the unity of the entire opposition around the essential. He must lay the foundations for the Rassemblement pour une Alternance Pacifique, Inclusive et D\u00e9mocratique (RAPID), a crucial initiative to ensure a rapid and democratic change in 2025,' he said.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 09:09 PM\nSource:[Abidjan.net](https://news.abidjan.net/articles/739011/presidentielle-2025-affi-nguessan-appelle-laurent-gbagbo-a-rassembler-lopposition-ivoirienne-abidjan)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is broad consensus that the probability of at least one of the named candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) being disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025 is high. Multiple experts highlight the recent disqualification of high-profile opposition figures, such as Tidjane Thiam and Laurent Gbagbo, as strong precedent for further exclusions, noting that the Ivorian regime routinely uses the judiciary and administrative mechanisms to restrict opposition participation. The status quo is that Gbagbo has already been disqualified due to a prior conviction, and others, especially Simone Gbagbo, remain at risk due to ongoing or past legal issues. Factors increasing the probability include the regime's history of manipulating candidate lists, weak judicial independence, base rates from past elections, fragmentation of the opposition, and the use of legal-technical grounds to justify exclusions.\n\nSlightly offsetting these factors are considerations such as increased domestic protest activity, some international scrutiny (from bodies like ECOWAS and the African Court), and the narrowing window for administrative or legal action as deadlines approach. Even so, most experts believe these pressures only modestly decrease the probability. A few outlier experts, applying elite theory or focusing on the advanced stage of the exclusion process, suggest a lower risk for new disqualifications (around 27\u201335%), reasoning that the regime may feel secure with the main threats already eliminated and additional exclusions could entail higher political costs. However, the predominant view, especially among those focused on legal, electoral, and democratization dynamics, is that the risk remains very substantial\u2014with probabilities often above 70\u201380% and some as high as 97%.\n\nIn summary, the aggregation of expert forecasts strongly points to a high likelihood (typically 70\u201390%) that at least one of the named candidates will be (or continue to be) officially disqualified before July 1, 2025, primarily due to persistent regime incentives, established exclusionary practices, unresolved legal vulnerabilities for several opposition figures, and a history of last-minute disqualifications in Ivorian elections."
