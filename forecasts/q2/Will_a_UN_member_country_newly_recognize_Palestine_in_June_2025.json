Both France and Italy are on record as planning recognition 'in June', with France making exceptionally strong commitments in recent days, and Malta mentioned as a likely candidate by Axios reports. Novelty of recognition is likely (i.e., new states, not mere repeats), and there is a clear history of European recognition clustering at diplomatic inflection points. The key risk is that hesitation or political backlash leads to deferral\u2014yet the convergence of political intent, public commitment, absence of significant US opposition, and the built-in diplomatic theater of a major conference makes at least one act of recognition highly probable.

Constructivist analysis strongly suggests that, in face of a humanitarian crisis and norm cascade, a symbolic act from a norm entrepreneur like France is both likely and impactful, especially when backed by other mid-level powers. Israeli threats, while aimed to deter, likely strengthen the resolve for states acting out of moral or identity motives. Importantly, domestic backlash in France (and perhaps Belgium/Malta/UK/Canada) is outweighed right now by international pressure and shifting Western opinion. Unilateralism is less likely, but the multilateral frame of the June conference and signaling by UK/France/Canada essentially guarantee at least one announcement.

The base rate of recognitions is low in non-wave years, but the past year saw a clear new surge in recognitions (Spain, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia in 2024), suggesting the window is open and peer effects are at work. Furthermore, the alignment of public pressure, international outrage over Gaza, and elite diplomatic signaling create the highest probability environment for a major recognition announcement in years. The key caveat is that last-minute diplomatic hesitation or domestic setbacks could delay a formal statement.

The trend since late 2023 has been accelerated recognition during periods of crisis, with at least five new recognitions in 2024-early 2025. Israeli deterrence is strongest against EU heavyweights, but French leadership and the public shift in UK/Canadian postures have somewhat neutralized the chilling effects. US opposition is muted but not obstructive. The most likely scenario is that France, probably alongside at least one partner (perhaps the UK), will move ahead with recognition between June 17-20 or in the conference's diplomatic afterglow. The only major mitigating factors are the possibility of collective-action hesitancy (if one key partner backs out) and the risk of requiring more Palestinian commitments on demilitarization.

The very high base rate for recognitions at diplomatic inflection points supports my initial confidence, but does not eliminate procedural or posturing risk, especially for a public-facing recognition act by a major power like France or Italy. The window (June) could slip for purely tactical reasons. That said, the consistency and external validation from group forecasts slightly boosts my confidence, and I now place moderate additional weight on the near-term likelihood of at least one minor state (Malta, Belgium) stepping forward even if larger states hedge.

While I maintain that the confluence of public signaling, summit choreography, and collective diplomatic process make recognition extremely likely, it is prudent to allow somewhat more room for bureaucratic inertia, coordination hiccups, and unforeseen developments that could delay formal announcements just outside the June window. Conversely, the defense of high probabilities by several forecasters underscores the genuine exceptional nature of this diplomatic moment and the unprecedented public commitments from France and others. The overall balance of evidence still heavily favors a Yes resolution, but after reflecting on the small but real risk of delay, I am nudging my probability slightly downward.",

Critiques focused on procedural risk (last-minute delay, ambiguity of recognition, bureaucratic inertia), but these arguments are mitigated by the unique set of pressures and symbolic incentives Macron and France face: the reputational cost of a walk-back at this point would be dramatically higher than in previous similar cycles, and the presence of a multilateral, high-profile diplomatic summit further reduces the risk of hesitation. Constructivist and norm cascade analysis is particularly apt in this scenario; waiting for another wave of recognition signals would be excessively cautious given the enormous diplomatic and normative investment converging on June. While I recognize there remains a non-zero risk of technical or procedural deferral (e.g., an announcement being delayed to early July, or one country's government hedging at the last moment), the base rate for surprise walk-backs in such highly orchestrated settings is very low. As such, I will revise my probability upward to reflect a sharper appreciation for the strength of this diplomatic commitment and the diminishing relevance of delay arguments.",

They make compelling arguments: the intensity and coordination of explicit signaling from France (and potentially other states), the summit's symbolic importance as a multilateral Schelling point, and the reputational and credibility costs of failing to follow through have all reached unusual heights. Critiques of my position emphasize how much the centralized, top-down structure of French executive decision-making increases follow-through odds, and that bureaucratic or procedural inertia is less likely to obstruct a clearly pre-scripted diplomatic act. The procedural caution remains somewhat relevant (and I still see last-minute delay as possible), but the sheer density of elite signaling, domestic and international political alignments, and the presence of anchor states willing to take the reputational lead outweigh these risks. In sum: the combined evidence and peer critique justify moving my probability up to align more closely with the \u2018very high but not certain\u2019 camp. I now revise up to 90%.",

The legalist caution that could push for a slightly lower number is outweighed by the repeated, near-public commitment of France, the coordinated summit as a diplomatic Schelling point, and recent historical patterns (such as the 2024 wave). Furthermore, several arguments highlight that even if a major power hesitated, a smaller state like Malta could well provide the 'Yes' outcome required by the resolution criteria. The main risk is not in lack of intent, but a technical misfire such as a statement falling just outside the resolution window\u2014a possibility, but a slim one. Given the group\u2019s strong push for a higher figure (some suggest 90-95%, countering my original conservatism), and the steady build-up in both rhetoric and stage-managed diplomacy, it is justified to bump up the forecast. The likelihood is now best captured in the 90% range: high enough to discount random delays, tidy enough to admit a slim chance of slippage, but not absolute.",

Critiques rightly caution against ignoring the possibility of late-stage procedural delays, political hedging, or intra-cabinet dissent\u2014risks historically present even at high diplomatic moments. However, robust defenses of the high forecast highlight the reputational costs leaders like Macron would bear from a high-profile walk-back, the readiness of smaller states to act independently, and the unusual pressure for visible action in this window.

Multiple valid critiques caution against taking high-level rhetoric or conference optics at face value, noting bureaucratic or political friction can still delay formal acts of recognition at the last moment. However, the collective judgment is that this specific window features the rare alignment of international focal point (the June conference), explicit leader commitments (especially from France), and cumulative international momentum seen only in prior high-yield recognition waves. Several robust defenses of higher estimates reference the reputational and diplomatic cost of retreating after such public signaling, and highlight the unprecedented level of state-level orchestration, which further reduces usual inertia.

The legalists\u2019 warnings about possible procedural delays and the historical stickiness of European coalition politics are not baseless, but appear somewhat outweighed by (1) the precommitment of national leaders, (2) the reputational and diplomatic risk of a walk-back at this summit, and (3) strong analogies to recent recognition clusters following clear signaling (as in 2024). The fact that a single country's recognition is sufficient for a 'Yes' outcome, and with smaller willing states in play, now seems even more salient. The main rational case for not going above 90%\u2014even with this convergence\u2014is the absolute requirement for a formal legal act and the still nonzero, if small, risk of last-minute deferral or delay. After deliberation and weighing both the more confident and more cautious peer forecasts, I now judge a probability at the very high end of the plausible range is appropriate. There is still some small risk of delay/deferral, but the summit choreography and explicit national commitments argue for a considerably higher probability.",

According to a French diplomat, President Emmanuel Macron hopes that the collective declaration at the conference will serve as a catalyst to revive stalled peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Macron stated, 'Recognizing the state of Palestine is not only a moral duty, but a political necessity,' although such recognition would require specific conditions, including the demilitarization of Hamas. France, Canada, and the UK have collectively criticized Israel's war in Gaza and declared their commitment to recognizing the state of Palestine as a step towards peace. Currently, 147 out of the 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a country. Israel strongly opposes this recognition effort, warning that it may trigger further annexation of the West Bank.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[TEMPO.CO](https://en.tempo.co/read/2012718/israel-fears-frances-push-for-palestine-state-recognition)\n\n**International Recognition of Palestine Continues to Grow: Four European Countries Call for Full UN Membership**\nFour European countries, including Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, have called for Palestine to be recognized as a full member of the United Nations in a joint statement. This comes after three European countries, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia, recognized Palestine in May 2024. France and Italy have also started to follow suit, recognizing Palestine after the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the war that killed children at the hands of the Israeli occupation. The four countries emphasized that recognizing Palestine and granting it full membership in the UN is a political and diplomatic necessity, not just a moral stance, in light of the long-standing stalemate in the peace process. This move comes as part of a wave of increased international recognition of Palestine, with 147 countries out of 193 UN member states recognizing Palestine so far. Italy, which had been trying to avoid condemning Israel since the start of the Gaza war, voted in favor of the second resolution on the situation in Gaza in the World Health Organization, which addresses the human situation and the collapsed health system and calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and unrestricted access to aid. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned that Gaza has become a 'trap of death' and called on the Israeli government to 'return to its senses' and facilitate the passage of humanitarian aid to the strip, while France remains 'committed' to recognizing Palestine as a state. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albarres also emphasized the need to break the blockade on Gaza and enable Palestinians to access humanitarian aid without obstacles, describing what is happening in the strip as 'unacceptable'. He also asked his American counterpart, Marco Rubio, to use his influence to achieve this goal, considering the US a 'very important and essential country in the world with great political and diplomatic weight'. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also confirmed that there is a clear violation of international human rights law by Israel, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of detainees. He also stated that Italy will recognize the Palestinian state, emphasizing the need for a negotiating process with Israel that recognizes both states.

He emphasized that Europe must take a stronger collective stance against Israel if Israel does not provide a sufficient response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in the coming hours and days. Macron announced plans to convene an international conference on the two-state solution in June, with Saudi Arabia as co-chair. He noted that France may recognize Palestine in the coming months, but this step must be part of a coordinated process involving regional countries and Israel. Macron also called on the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands to join in recognizing the Palestinian state. France is pushing for immediate diplomatic action before the June UN conference, emphasizing that recognition of Palestine should be part of comprehensive efforts to achieve sustainable peace and security in the region, as well as the resumption of the political process based on the two-state principle and mutual recognition. Macron said, 'If there is no reaction to Gaza, France will take a step further.' Israel harshly criticized the initiative, accusing France of legitimizing Hamas.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[vesti.az](https://www.vesti.az/v-mire/pariz-zovet-evropu-k-sovmestnomu-priznaniyu-palestinskogo-gosudarstva-547268)\n\n**Four European Countries Call for Palestine's Recognition as a Full UN Member**\nFour European countries have called for the recognition of Palestine as a full member of the United Nations.

The conference will focus on the settlement of the Palestinian issue and the implementation of the two-state solution, which is the only internationally agreed-upon solution. The majority of UN member and observer states have expressed their full support for the efforts made by Saudi Arabia and France to prepare for the conference.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/saudi-today/2025/05/30/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-)\n\n**Paris Calls for Joint Recognition of Palestinian State**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stated at a press conference in Singapore that recognizing the Palestinian state is not only a moral obligation but also a political necessity, according to Vesti.az citing international media. He emphasized that Europe must take a stronger collective stance against Israel if Israel does not provide a sufficient response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in the coming hours and days. Macron announced plans to convene an international conference on the two-state solution in June, with Saudi Arabia as co-chair. He noted that France may recognize Palestine in the coming months, but this step must be part of a coordinated process involving regional countries and Israel. Macron also called on the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands to join in recognizing the Palestinian state. France is pushing for immediate diplomatic action before the June UN conference, emphasizing that recognition of Palestine should be part of comprehensive efforts to achieve sustainable peace and security in the region, as well as the resumption of the political process based on the two-state principle and mutual recognition. Macron said, 'If there is no reaction to Gaza, France will take a step further.' Israel harshly criticized the initiative, accusing France of legitimizing Hamas.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[vesti.az](https://www.vesti.az/v-mire/pariz-zovet-evropu-k-sovmestnomu-priznaniyu-palestinskogo-gosudarstva-547268)\n\n**Spain, Norway, Ireland, and Slovenia Renew Support for Two-State Solution in Palestine and Israel**\nSpain, Norway, Ireland, and Slovenia have renewed their support for the creation of two states in Palestine and Israel, one year after recognizing the Palestinians. In a statement from the Spanish Foreign Ministry, they recalled that at the Madrid+ Group meeting, these four countries reaffirmed their commitment to international efforts to implement the two-state solution. The statement noted that this commitment has had an undeniable impact on the international dynamics related to the conflict in Gaza, generating momentum for the implementation of the two-state solution after many years of stagnation. The statement also mentioned the creation of the Global Alliance to Implement the Two-State Solution in September 2024 at the United Nations, and the approval of the UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/79/81 on December 10, 2024, which called for a High-Level Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the Palestinian Question and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution. The conference will be held on June 17, 2025, under the auspices of the United Nations and will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. The statement concluded that it is the responsibility of the parties to bring peace to the region, but the international community has the obligation to alter the current dynamics on the ground that have created an endless cycle of violence and devastation. Meanwhile, students in Senegal protested and expelled the Israeli ambassador from the University of Dakar, and personalities and organizations in Brazil have demanded the rupture of diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel. The Brazilian government has been criticized for maintaining commercial relations with Israel despite its official declarations against the Israeli aggression in Gaza. The letter, organized by the entity Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, demands the implementation of military and energy embargoes against the Israeli government and the rupture of diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel. The letter has been signed by 113 individuals, six political parties, seven trade unions, 29 Arab and Palestinian organizations, and 89 civil society organizations in Brazil.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[resumenlatinoamericano.org](https://www.resumenlatinoamericano.org/2025/05/29/palestina-espana-noruega-irlanda-y-eslovenia-renuevan-su-apoyo-al-estado-palestino-estudiantes-senegaleses-abuchean-y-expulsan-al-embajador-israeli-de-la-universidad-de-dakar-personalidades-y-o/)\n\n**Four European Countries Call for Palestine's Recognition as a Full UN Member**\nFour European countries have called for the recognition of Palestine as a full member of the United Nations.

This call came during a meeting of the 'Madrid+' group, where the countries stressed that recognizing Palestine and granting it full UN membership has become a necessary political and diplomatic step, rather than just a moral stance, given the prolonged stalemate in the peace process.

In a joint statement, they reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the two-state solution, a year after officially recognizing the State of Palestine. They stated that 'in the framework of the Madrid+ group meeting, we met today to renew and strengthen the international commitment to implementing the two-state solution, and to emphasize that the Palestinian state, capable of living and connected geographically, within internationally recognized borders, consisting of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and its capital, East Jerusalem, is the only one capable of meeting the national aspirations and the requirements of peace and security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.' They added that this commitment has had a significant impact on the international dynamics related to the conflict in Gaza, and has created a new momentum towards implementing the two-state solution. After years of stagnation, implementing the two-state solution and recognizing Palestine is no longer just a moral stance, but a necessary step to revive the spirit of implementing this solution. They emphasized that the International Peace Conference, scheduled to be held on June 17 under the auspices of the United Nations and co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is not only an opportunity, but also the most suitable framework to move forward in implementing the two-state solution. They also stated that recognizing Palestine is another step towards implementing the two-state solution, calling on all members of the international community to take the necessary steps to make this solution a reality, including individual recognition of Palestine by those who have not done so, granting Palestine full membership in the United Nations, and supporting an agreement between the two parties that includes mutual recognition between Palestine and Israel.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062e\u0628\u0631\u0646\u064a](https://www.khaberni.com/news/712661-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AC-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9)\n\n**What France\u2019s \u2018Peace\u2019 Conference Is Really About**\nFrance is hosting a UN conference with Saudi Arabia to supposedly solve the Arab-Israeli conflict by June 20.

Instead, France is likely to recognize a Palestinian state and encourage the UK to do so, which would be a 'Euro-Arab confab to beat up on Israel.' The article questions the legitimacy of recognizing a Palestinian state, citing the lack of a previous sovereign Palestinian state and the unclear borders of a new state. It also criticizes the International Criminal Court (ICC) for pursuing war-crimes charges against Israel, arguing that there is no competing claim of sovereignty and that Israel's administration of the territory is not an 'occupation' in the traditional sense.

'We will respond with our own unilateral actions to any unilateral step against Israel,' he said in an interview with Israel Hayom. This statement comes as an international conference on recognizing Palestine is being prepared, which is expected to take place on June 18 in New York with the participation of France, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries. According to the publication, the conference's initiator is French President Emmanuel Macron, who hopes that on this day many countries will officially recognize Palestine. Saar strongly criticized this initiative, despite the fact that, as the newspaper claims, Macron previously assured Israeli authorities that he would not take such steps without consulting with Tel Aviv. The US has informed Israel that it will not participate in the conference, but will not publicly pressure other countries to refrain from doing so. Currently, 149 out of 193 UN member states have officially recognized Palestine. The Palestinian administration hopes that the June conference will lead to an increase in this number. According to the Committee for the Struggle against the 'Separation Barrier' and Illegal Settlements, by the end of 2024, there will be approximately 770,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank, 180 official settlements, and another 256 unrecognized outposts, not recognized even by the Israeli government. In the context of the Gaza war, Israel has significantly expanded its military operations on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Since October 7, 2023, over 960 Palestinians have been killed, around 7,000 injured, and over 16,000 arrested, according to Palestinian authorities. In July 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel must immediately stop building new settlements and withdraw its citizens from all occupied Palestinian territories, but Israeli authorities refused to comply.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 08:56 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80/%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BB-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD/3579617)\n\n**Israel Threatens to Annex West Bank Settlements and Jordan Valley in Response to Palestinian State Recognition**\nIsraeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, has threatened to impose sovereignty over West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley in response to any international recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Israeli newspaper 'Israel Hayom'. Lapid stated, 'Any unilateral steps against Israel will be met with unilateral steps from us,' indicating Israel's intention to respond to international recognition by annexing Palestinian territories. The newspaper reported that Lapid warned countries planning to recognize a Palestinian state, including Britain and France, that this move would be met with Israel's unilateral annexation of West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley. This warning comes as French President Emmanuel Macron is leading efforts to convene an international conference in New York in mid-June to secure international recognition of a Palestinian state, backed by Saudi Arabia. Sources close to the newspaper reported that Macron aims to have June 18 as the date for official announcements from several countries recognizing a Palestinian state, which has sparked anger from the Israeli government.

This statement is expected to be made on June 20 at an international summit organized by Saudi Arabia and France, with the participation of the UN. Malta has already established diplomatic relations with Palestine and supported a UN resolution on Palestine's full membership in the organization in 2024. Experts believe that Malta's upcoming statement may serve as a catalyst for other countries considering similar steps. Hamas has previously hailed such initiatives as a 'significant achievement', while Israel's Foreign Minister has strongly condemned them, calling them 'encouraging terrorism'. There is a high probability that Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Palestine in the near future. So far, Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia have recognized Palestine's independence in 2024. The League of Arab States has also adopted a declaration confirming the Palestinian people's right to create their own state in March 2025. Arab countries have called on Israel to stop military actions on the West Bank and to abandon plans to build new Jewish settlements, demolish Palestinian homes, and conduct operations in the Gaza Strip. Palestine declared its independence in 1988, and its status has been recognized by over 140 UN member states, including Russia, China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others.

French President Emmanuel Macron has hinted that France may take this step, but 'not on emotions.' Many international allies have reevaluated their relationships with Israel due to ongoing conflicts in the Gaza Strip. France plans to officially recognize Palestine as a state in June, Axios reports. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has received unprecedented international support since the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israeli territory, but has 'lost many of his remaining friends on the West' in recent months, Axios notes. The international community's support for Netanyahu has waned as the Israeli military has advanced in the Gaza Strip. The dissatisfaction on the West reached its peak when Israel announced the start of a new ground operation in the Gaza Strip, according to Axios. Now, more countries are considering recognizing Palestine as a sovereign state, including France and Saudi Arabia. They will co-chair an international conference on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in June, and may announce recognition of Palestine after the summit, Axios reports. Macron said that the decision will be made when it is beneficial, but not 'on emotions.' Norway recognized Palestine as a state last year, followed by Spain and Ireland. In response, Israel recalled its ambassadors from all three European countries. Netanyahu called their decision 'a reward for terrorism.' The League of Arab States presented a declaration in March 2025, stating that the Palestinian people have the right to create a state. Arab countries called on Israel to stop aggression on the West Bank, including stopping the construction of new Jewish settlements, demolishing Palestinian homes, and conducting military operations in Palestinian settlements.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/25/05/2025/68333b409a7947288e3fc7f3)\n\n**France, UK, and Canada Signal Willingness to Recognize Palestine as a State**\nThe international debate on recognizing Palestine has resurfaced, with France, the UK, and Canada signaling their willingness to recognize Palestine as a state.

The French Foreign Ministry has also emphasized the need for a 'new impetus' before the summit, and has called for countries that have not recognized Palestine to do so. The UK and Canada have also expressed their support for the two-state solution, with the UK stating that it is 'prepared to work with our allies and other actors in the region' to achieve this goal.

According to a diplomatic source, the meeting will take place on Friday afternoon and will be a working session, with no press conference to follow. The conference, which will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is scheduled to take place in New York from June 17 to 20. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced this week that France is committed to recognizing a Palestinian state, a move that is likely to strain relations with Israel. 'For a two-state solution, the issue of mutual recognition between states is of paramount importance,' said French Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Christophe Lemoine. 'If we want to talk about a two-state solution, countries that have not recognized Palestine must recognize it, and countries that have not recognized Israel must take steps towards normalization,' he added. Around 150 countries recognize Palestine, which has observer status at the United Nations, but cannot become a full member without a Security Council vote. In 2020, the Abraham Accords, brokered by Donald Trump, led to normalization of relations between Israel and three Arab countries: the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco. However, many Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, have refused to join these agreements, as have Israel's neighbors, Syria and Lebanon. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in December 2024 calling for genuine negotiations on the Middle East peace process and decided to hold an 'international high-level conference for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question and the implementation of a two-state solution' in June in New York, with Paris and Riyadh co-chairing the conference.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 10:56 AM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ara/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%AD%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86/89400396)\n\n**International Conference to Revive Two-State Solution in June**\nA high-level international conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia to revive a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, known as the 'two-state solution', will take place from June 17 to 20, confirmed Sharon Birch, spokesperson for the UN General Assembly, to AFP.

He said, 'The Palestinian issue is just, and Palestinians deserve their own state,' noting that recognizing Palestine is part of the Labour Party's electoral program. Lamy added, 'The only option is a two-state solution,' reaffirming the UK's continued work with France and Saudi Arabia to ensure the success of the New York Conference, aimed at maintaining this solution. He also pointed out that recognition is not the end goal but the beginning of a realistic political process, highlighting the UK's role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council in driving the process forward.

Canada has also tightened its leash, banning new arms exports to Israel since January 2024 and suspending around 30 permits. However, existing permits remain active, allowing up to $95 million CAD worth of military goods to be exported. Macron stated, 'We must move toward recognition [of a Palestinian state], and so, in the coming months, we will.' His vision is for a moment of reciprocal acknowledgment, where Palestine is recognized as sovereign and in turn, Israel is recognized by Arab nations. This shift marks a historic inflection point in the West's posture on Israel-Palestine, with the European Union, Belgium, and Spain also tightening scrutiny and the United Nations supporting a ceasefire and two-state resolution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 12, 2025 01:48 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@jahansher/france-president-macron-backs-palestine-canada-cuts-arms-supply-to-israel-55796ee991d1)\n\n**France to Recognize Palestine as a State by June**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced that France plans to recognize Palestine as a state by June at the earliest. Macron stated, 'We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the next few months.' He added, 'Our goal is to co-host a conference with Saudi Arabia in June at the UN, where we will discuss the recognition of Palestine.' Macron emphasized that the recognition of Palestine is not done to please anyone, but because he believes it is the right thing to do. He also stated, 'I want to be part of a common dynamic with those who support Palestine, where we all recognize Israel.' Macron's announcement comes after Israel resumed its airstrikes on the Gaza Strip last month. He met with Palestinian patients in hospitals near the Gaza border during his three-day visit to Egypt from April 7. France's decision is a significant political shift among European countries. France has supported a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine since the Gaza War in July 2023. Palestinian Foreign Minister Bassam al-Sabah welcomed France's recognition of Palestine, saying it is a 'step in the right direction' that protects Palestinian rights and supports a two-state solution. However, Israel, which has maintained a friendly relationship with France but opposes a two-state solution, criticized the move. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar tweeted, 'Recognizing a fictional Palestinian state unilaterally will reward terrorism and encourage Hamas.' He added, 'This action will only push our region further away from peace, security, and stability.' Currently, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state, with Ireland, Norway, Spain, and Slovenia joining the list last year. However, major Western countries such as the US, Australia, the UK, and Germany have yet to recognize Palestine.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: April 10, 2025 08:29 PM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/europe/1191889.html)\n\n**Mapping which countries recognise Palestine in 2025**\n147 countries, representing 75 percent of UN members, recognise the State of Palestine as a sovereign nation. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France plans to recognise a Palestinian state within months, which could lead to some Middle Eastern countries formally recognising the State of Israel. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the announcement as 'a step in the right direction'. Currently, 10 countries have formally recognised the State of Palestine in 2025, bringing the total to 147. Recognising Palestine strengthens its global standing, improves its capacity to hold Israeli authorities accountable, and pressures Western powers to act on the two-state solution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 10, 2025 07:01 AM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025)\n\n**Macron Signals Possible Recognition of Palestinian State in June**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stated in a recent interview with France 5 that France may recognize the Palestinian state in the near future, specifically in June. Macron emphasized that 'we will do this in the next few months. I'm not doing this to please anyone. I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do at some point.' He also noted that this move would be part of a collective dynamic that would also require Israel to recognize Palestine. Macron aims to chair an international conference in June, along with Saudi Arabia, to facilitate mutual recognition between the two states. However, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar responded negatively to Macron's statement, saying that such actions would 'not bring peace, security, and stability to our region, but rather push it further away.' Saar also warned that unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state would be 'nothing but a reward for terrorism and Hamas.' Despite this, Palestine has been recognized as a sovereign state by around 150 countries, with the notable exception of the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan. On the other hand, countries that do not recognize Israel include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: April 10, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[NTV](https://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/macrondan-filistin-devletini-tanima-sinyali-haziran-ayina-isaret-etti,tY9PoFD04EiKGeDq7HNIsQ)\n\n**Macron says France could recognise Palestinian state**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that France could recognize a Palestinian state 'in the coming months'. Macron aims to finalize the move at a United Nations conference in June, which France will co-chair with Saudi Arabia. This move would be a significant shift in policy, as several major Western countries, including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany, have withheld recognition. Macron believes that recognizing Palestine as a state would allow France to 'be clear in our fight against those who deny Israel's right to exist' and to commit to 'collective security in the region'. However, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has warned that 'unilateral recognition' of a Palestinian state would be a 'boost for Hamas'. Palestine has been recognized as a sovereign state by 146 out of 193 UN members, with several countries joining their ranks last year. Macron also foresees a 'collective dynamic', where some countries in the Middle East would recognize the Israeli state in turn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/9/macron-says-france-could-recognise-palestinian-state-in-june)\n\n**France could recognize Palestinian state 'in June': Macron**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stated that France could recognize the state of Palestine 'in June' during an international conference co-hosted with Saudi Arabia in New York. Macron emphasized the need to move towards recognition, saying, 'We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months.' He also highlighted the importance of the conference, stating, 'Our goal is to chair this conference (on Palestine) with Saudi Arabia sometime in June, where we could finalize this movement of mutual recognition by several parties.' Macron's remarks come amid growing international calls for a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has resulted in over 50,000 deaths in Gaza since October 2023. Currently, 147 of the 193 UN member states recognize the state of Palestine, with several European countries, including Spain, Ireland, and Norway, having joined the list in recent months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 06:42 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/france-could-recognize-palestinian-state-in-june-macron/3533292)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of at least one UN member country newly recognizing Palestine in June 2025 is high, primarily due to a scheduled international conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia (June 17\u201320), explicit and repeated public commitments from French and other Western leaders, recent precedent of recognition 'waves,' and increasing diplomatic momentum among major European powers. Factors such as public signaling by France (President Macron's commitment to a June recognition), supportive noises from the UK, Italy, Belgium, and Malta, alongside the base rate of clustered recognitions around significant diplomatic events, all substantially increase the likelihood. \n\nWhile some experts highlight potential constraints\u2014such as last-minute diplomatic hesitancy, procedural delays, Israeli threats of retaliation, or the requirement for recognition to be formal and documented within the window\u2014these are generally considered less influential than the strong diplomatic choreography and elite signaling for coordinated recognition at this moment. The US's restrained position (not actively opposing) removes a historic obstacle, making Western European action more probable.\n\nAll perspectives point to the June conference serving as a \"focal point\" or catalyst, with strong historical parallels to earlier recognition surges (e.g., Kosovo 2008, Palestine 2011, and 2024). Most experts judge the odds of a 'Yes' outcome at 80\u201395%, with only PoliticalScienceComparativePolitics and MiddleEastStudiesArabIsraeliConflictStudies slightly more cautious (70\u201375%), citing the perennial risk of elite indecision or the requirement for multilateral cover causing delay. Nevertheless, the consensus is that at least one newly formalized recognition is very likely to occur and be reported by credible sources within June 2025."
