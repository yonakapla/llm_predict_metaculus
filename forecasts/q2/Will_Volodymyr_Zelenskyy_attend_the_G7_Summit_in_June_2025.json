The only meaningful negative factors are the possibility of acute military escalation in Ukraine or severe, unforeseen security threats; however, there is at present no direct evidence of an imminent crisis that would force a change. The scheduling of the NATO Summit a week later complicates Zelensky's travel but does not preclude the G7 appearance.

Historically, only extreme operational crises (e.g., unforeseen collapse or decapitation threats) prevent his travel, and current threat intelligence does not suggest such a scenario is imminent in the 12-day time window. While the Russian buildup near Sumy is notable, Ukraine's government has demonstrated an ability to continue high-level diplomatic engagement even during active combat phases. Logistical, security, and political factors are all well within the range managed in past trips. The resolution criteria are clear: in-person, physical presence. I estimate a base rate for Zelenskyy in-person attendance at G7 summits since 2022 at above 90%, adjusting down slightly for the risk of crisis.

You cite 'strong positive indicators' and 'prudent discount for possible security shocks,' but there are no solid signals indicating a specific, credible threat window for this summit. If anything, open comms from both Ukraine and Canada are more affirmative than ever for this appearance. The tactical situation doesn't exist in a vacuum\u2014he's shored up domestic control, the delegation system is robust, and the base rate for sudden no-shows is exceedingly low, especially two weeks out. Bumping this scenario down to 88% over-indexes undefined volatility and underestimates the existential importance to both Zelenskyy and the G7 of sending a public, united message. You need to recognize that not all war-related risk is created equal\u2014or equally relevant. Raise your odds."

The forecaster succinctly captures why the true disruptors would be rare, such as a sudden security collapse or events directly impacting Presidential mobility and safety\u2014not just incremental battlefield deterioration.

The forecast recognizes how summit diplomacy is now a core pillar of Ukraine's war strategy, with robust G7 host arrangements and a playbook for rapid, secure state visits that's been hardened by three years of practice under fire. While others hedge for unlikely but amorphous scenarios, this view sharpens probability where the evidence leads\u2014high, yes, but just below certainty for that ever-present remote shock.

The explicit point about robust state protocol and Canadian security infrastructure is not just obvious\u2014it\u2019s empirically validated by every prior summit. This forecast wisely ranks the 'cost of non-attendance' for both Ukraine and the G7 at near-catastrophic, giving real-world political constraints the real-world weight they deserve.

However, since nearly all experts cluster very tightly (88\u201393%), and after further weighing the extremely high diplomatic cost of Zelenskyy not attending against the incremental, but realistically unchanged, risk vector since Phase 1, I see no justification to materially increase or decrease my assessed probability.

The main differentiator is the degree of caution regarding tail risk. Critiques of overly cautious estimates (e.g., 88%) are persuasive\u2014Zelenskyy and his team have demonstrated exceptional adaptability, and the diplomatic machinery now routinely mitigates most foreseeable contingencies. In this context, the odds that routine or even moderately escalated battlefield risks will prevent travel within the narrow summit window are lower than the most conservative forecasters suggest.

In addition, several group comments reinforce that summit protocols, air corridors, and risk management have become institutionalized, reducing the residual uncertainty to a much smaller portion of the plausible risk envelope.

Defenses of more bullish predictions, referencing well-honed diplomatic and security protocols, further support dialing up the boldness towards the empirically justified extreme.

The current evidence\u2014affirmed G7 invitation, Zelenskyy's public commitment, lack of credible indicators of a new acute military crisis in the window, and a proven Ukrainian ability to execute secure high-level travel\u2014supports an even bolder forecast.

Repeated critiques from SecurityIntelligenceAnalysisStrategicThreatAssessment and PoliticalSciencePoliticalRiskAnalysis compellingly point out that, short of a direct collapse in Kyiv or immediate threat to Zelenskyy, there is little evidence that heightened battlefield activity (such as the Sumy build-up) would preclude travel. The discipline shown by state protocol teams and the strong mutual incentives between Ukraine and Western allies to ensure in-person representation further diminish the plausibility of last-minute disruption.

Sheinbaum said that attending the summit was a possibility, but some argue that she should not go because US President Trump may 'embosk' her, as he did to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The real concern is that Trump may make public statements about certain Mexican politicians. The G-7 summit will be held from June 15 to 17 in Kananakis, Alberta, and will include leaders from France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Italy, and the European Union. Carney wants to negotiate the elimination of tariffs before the renegotiation of the USMCA trade agreement. Sheinbaum's reluctance to accept the invitation is questionable, given that all countries attending the summit, except for Brazil, Ukraine, and the UK, have a trade agreement with Mexico and are major investors. Sheinbaum will face criticism for the judicial reform and other legislative changes implemented by her government that affect trade agreements and investment in Mexico. To eliminate tariffs and the remittance tax, Sheinbaum must speak with Trump, as he is the only one who decides on US commercial policy. If Sheinbaum decides not to attend the summit, it may put the future of the USMCA as a trilateral agreement at risk, negatively affecting growth expectations and the exchange rate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:53 AM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/jorge-molina-larrondo/2025/06/02/sheinbaum-el-g-7-y-el-tmec/)\n\n**Zelenskyy says Ukraine has invitation to attend NATO summit**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine has been invited to the NATO summit in The Hague at the end of June.

Sheinbaum said that attending the summit was a possibility, but some argue that she should not go because US President Trump may 'embosk' her, as he did to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The real concern is that Trump may make public statements about certain Mexican politicians. The G-7 summit will be held from June 15 to 17 in Kananakis, Alberta, and will include leaders from France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Italy, and the European Union. Carney wants to negotiate the elimination of tariffs before the renegotiation of the USMCA trade agreement. Sheinbaum's reluctance to accept the invitation is questionable, given that all countries attending the summit, except for Brazil, Ukraine, and the UK, have a trade agreement with Mexico and are major investors. Sheinbaum will face criticism for the judicial reform and other legislative changes implemented by her government that affect trade agreements and investment in Mexico. To eliminate tariffs and the remittance tax, Sheinbaum must speak with Trump, as he is the only one who decides on US commercial policy. If Sheinbaum decides not to attend the summit, it may put the future of the USMCA as a trilateral agreement at risk, negatively affecting growth expectations and the exchange rate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:53 AM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/jorge-molina-larrondo/2025/06/02/sheinbaum-el-g-7-y-el-tmec/)\n\n**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pays visit to Lithuania**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Vilnius to participate in a summit of the Bucharest Nine (B9) and the Nordic countries, according to his spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov.

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of Volodymyr Zelenskyy attending the G7 Summit in Canada in June 2025 is very high, generally placing it between 88% and 93%. Their analyses converge on several key factors: (1) Zelenskyy has received a formal invitation from Canadian PM Mark Carney and has publicly committed to attending, with explicit statements such as 'And I will be [there]'. (2) The base rate for his in-person attendance at major Western summits since the Russian invasion in 2022 is almost 100%, unless a severe domestic crisis intervenes. (3) The diplomatic, political, and strategic value for both Ukraine and the G7 of his attendance is extremely high\u2014his presence is vital for advocating support and reinforcing Western unity. (4) Major risks that could prevent his attendance include a sudden or severe escalation in the Russian offensive (notably near Sumy or Kyiv), a national emergency requiring his leadership in Ukraine, unforeseen personal or health incidents, or acute security threats related to his travel. (5) The presence of overlapping summits (e.g., the NATO summit a week later) is noted as only a minor complication, as Zelenskyy has previously managed similar overlapping deployments. All analyses stress that while no attendance is ever absolutely certain in a war context, the only credible scenario in which he would not go involves an extraordinary, last-minute crisis in Ukraine. Therefore, the consensus is for a high probability of Zelenskyy's in-person attendance, with a small downward adjustment reflecting non-negligible security and military risks typical of an ongoing conflict situation."
