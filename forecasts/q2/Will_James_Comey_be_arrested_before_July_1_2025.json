Elite Theory further underscores the high insulation provided by Comey\u2019s network position. However, the current period is marked by escalating elite retaliation and norm-breaking, and there is genuine, unusually high executive attention and pressure, especially since a recent assassination attempt on Trump has put security agencies in a highly reactive mode. Still, even in this hyper-polarized climate, the professional risk and likely backlash of an arrest\u2014without a 'smoking gun'\u2014will temper willingness to cross this Rubicon.

No new evidence emerged that would suggest a shift, nor did group discussion uncover a plausible path to Yes barring a black swan event. The only possible nudge downward would be to 2% to align even more tightly with the group, but since there is still a sliver more structural and headline-driven risk than absolute historic calm, I am holding steady at 3%.",

They correctly argue that 'elite insulation' should suppress the probability further, not encourage a significant bump without concrete evidence of law-defying escalation. Furthermore, case histories and base rates for analogous scenarios remain near-zero, and no new reporting suggests a paradigm shift is imminent. Thus, while elite retaliation and norm-breaking remain as wildcards, the risk premium I previously assigned was excessive. I now revise my probability downward to 3%, staying above zero only to account for the nonzero possibility of a truly unprecedented political-legal rupture in a highly abnormal environment.",

The arguments offered by others are overwhelmingly consistent with the legal and institutional analysis I provided: there is a virtual consensus among subject-matter experts (from criminal law, prosecutorial practice, and political institutional analysis) that the odds are vanishingly small barring a massive, presently unforeseeable political or evidentiary shock. Concerns about 'elite retaliation' or 'norm-breaking escalation' are largely theoretical, not reflected in actionable law enforcement or prosecutorial patterns, and those with somewhat higher probabilities (notably 6%) have been convincingly critiqued for overestimating the practical risk.

There were no credible arguments or new interpretations suggesting increased risk or overlooked legal/political mechanisms that would meaningfully elevate the risk. The operational realities, high institutional barriers, and absence of new evidence keep this probability at or even below my initial estimate.

Critiques of the higher (6%) scenario were pointed and persuasive, demonstrating robust institutional constraints on overreach, even in moments of political crisis. Defenses of the sub-3% range further highlighted that procedural inertia, DOJ and Secret Service risk aversion, and the absence of new, damning evidence keep handcuff risk extremely low. Nothing in the group review surfaced plausible paths to an arrest outcome barring unforeseeable, seismic new developments\u2014there are none currently reported or credibly rumored.

It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard.

Noem stated, 'DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.' Comey later claimed the post was 'a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.'

Patel stated that the increase in potential threats against Trump since Comey's publication on May 15 has been so great that the FBI has had to allocate significant resources, including agents trained in child sex crimes and drug trafficking, to investigate them. Patel expressed his frustration, saying, 'I have to take my agents and analysts away from pursuing child predators, fentanyl traffickers, terrorists... because all over the country people are appearing on social media thinking that a threat to the life of the President of the United States is a joke... and that they can do it because Comey did it.' Comey had posted a photo on Instagram of seashells arranged to form the number '8647', writing, 'Great shell formation on my beach walk.' The number '86' is colloquially associated with the act of expelling or eliminating something or someone, and the phrase '86 47' appears to convey a coded message advocating for the removal of the 47th president.

Comey posted a photo of oysters arranged in the numbers '86 47', which sparked a wave of imitations on social media. Wray noted that the term '86' in the criminal underworld can mean murder, making Comey's post particularly dangerous. As a result, agents had to be diverted from investigating pedophiles, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists to investigate threats against Trump. Wray expressed disappointment that such actions are perceived as a joke and emphasized that such incidents occur daily. The FBI did not provide details on the number of threats, but the situation worsened after two attempts on Trump's life last year, including an attack in Pennsylvania where a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Additionally, it was reported that Ryan Wesley Rut, the American arrested for attempting to kill Trump in September 2024, planned the attack with Ukrainian handlers. Rut had contacted an unknown Ukrainian individual a month before the attempt, who may have provided him with a weapon. Rut asked for a grenade or a FIM-92 Stinger portable air defense system to be sent to him.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:46 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6398603/)\n\n**Undocumented Immigrant Threatens Trump, Arrested by ICE**\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem stated, 'Thanks to our ICE agents, the undocumented immigrant who threatened to kill President Trump is now in prison.'

The numbers '86' is an argo term in the US meaning 'to escape' or 'to kill', and '47' is believed to refer to Donald Trump being the 47th President of the US. Comey denied the allegations of promoting violence, saying 'I am against all forms of violence' and removed the photo the same day. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service announced that they would investigate the incident on Thursday. Trump said in a Fox News interview that Comey's post was a call to kill him, saying 'Anyone can understand what this means. This is a call to assassination. He said it loudly and clearly.' Trump also said that the decision to prosecute Comey is in the hands of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 17, 2025 08:04 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/politika/james-comey-trump-a-suikast-cagrisi-iddiasiyla-sorgulandi-18640846-haberi/)\n\n**US Secret Service Interrogates James Comey Over Trump Assassination Post**\nThe US Secret Service has interrogated former FBI Director James Comey over a social media post that was perceived as a call to assassinate US President Donald Trump. According to The New York Times, Comey voluntarily agreed to the interrogation and was taken to the service's office in Washington by its agents. The investigation was sparked by a photo posted by Comey on social media, which featured 8647 seashells on the sand. In American slang, 'to 86' means to eliminate, and 47 is associated with Trump, the 47th President of the United States. After facing criticism, Comey deleted the post and explained in a new post that the seashells were a political message. However, he did not think that the numbers could be associated with violence by some people, which he does not support, as he said, 'I did not think that some people might interpret these numbers as a call to violence, which I do not support.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 17, 2025 07:20 AM\nSource:[BFM.ru - \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b](https://www.bfm.ru/news/573595)\n\n**Ex-FBI boss interviewed by Secret Service over Trump seashell post**\nFormer FBI director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service after sharing a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against US President Donald Trump.

Comey posted a picture of seashells forming the numbers '86 47', which some people believed referred to the 86th day of Trump's presidency and the 47th president. However, Comey claimed he didn't intend to threaten Trump and deleted the post. Experts say that prosecuting Comey would be unlikely to succeed, given the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 that requires prosecutors to show that a person has 'some understanding of the nature of their statements' to prove a threat. A former Secret Service agent said that Comey's post was 'not a direct threat' but 'extremely dangerous' in the current climate. A decision by the Supreme Court in 2023 makes it even less likely that federal prosecutors can bring a successful case against Comey. The decision, written by Justice Elena Kagan, held that prosecutors must demonstrate that a person has 'some subjective understanding of the nature of their statements' to prove a threat. 'To prosecute true threats, you need to show imprudence to align that prosecution with the First Amendment,' said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia.

Trump claims the post was a 'call to assassination' and has called for Comey to be prosecuted. However, experts say that prosecuting Comey would be unlikely to result in a conviction, citing a recent Supreme Court decision that sets a high bar for proving intent to threaten. 'It's not a direct threat. It doesn't say 'go out and kill Donald Trump'. It doesn't say that,' said Jon Wackrow, a CNN analyst and former Secret Service agent. 'But in the context of our current environment, this image is extremely dangerous, and even more so coming from someone like Comey, who should know better.' The Supreme Court decision in 2023 made it even less likely that federal prosecutors could bring a successful case against Comey. 'To prosecute threats, you need to show some subjective understanding of the threatening nature of your statements,' said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia. 'The court didn't distinguish between the person making the threat or the victim who is terrified.' The FIRE organization, a First Amendment defense group, said that Comey's post was within protected political speech and did not constitute a true threat. 'It's not a true threat, and it doesn't deserve federal investigation. 86 has many possible meanings, and the idea of expressing it in seashells and posting it on Instagram is quite exaggerated,' said the organization.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 16, 2025 08:17 PM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2025/05/16/eeuu/james-comey-redes-sociales-procesamiento-trax)\n\n**Prosecuting James Comey for social media posts may be fruitless, legal and security experts say**\nFormer FBI Director James Comey posted a picture of seashells writing out the numbers '86 47' on Instagram, which some interpreted as a threat against President Donald Trump.

Some supporters of Donald Trump interpreted the post as a call to kill the president. According to Reuters, the number 86 can be used to mean 'to throw someone out of a bar for being drunk', and 47 is the number of the president, Trump. NBC News notes that, according to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, 86 can also informally mean 'to get rid of someone'. US Homeland Security Secretary Christine Noem said that Comey 'just called for the murder of Trump'. 'The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service are investigating this threat and will respond accordingly,' Noem wrote. A Secret Service representative stated that the agency 'is thoroughly investigating anything that may be perceived as a potential threat to our protected individuals.' 'We are aware of the former FBI director's social media posts and take such rhetoric very seriously,' the statement read. Comey later deleted the photo and posted a statement saying, 'Earlier today, I posted a photo of seashells I saw on a beach walk that I thought might be a political message. I didn't realize that some people connected these numbers to violence.

    "summary": "Across eight expert forecasts, there is a strong consensus that the probability of James Comey being arrested before July 1, 2025, is very low\u2014generally ranging from 2% to 6%. The experts, drawing from backgrounds in federal law enforcement, legal practice, political science, and American studies, agree on several key factors: \n\n1. **Recent Supreme Court Precedent:** All forecasts highlight that the 2023 Supreme Court decision on 'true threats' requires proof of subjective intent, making it legally difficult to arrest or prosecute individuals for ambiguous or symbolic speech, like Comey's '86 47' social media post. This is a principal factor lowering probabilities across the board.\n\n2. **Status Quo and Investigative Context:** Comey has only undergone voluntary questioning by the Secret Service. There is no public evidence of probable cause, additional incriminating evidence, or imminent plans to arrest him. Voluntary cooperation and public renunciations of violence are repeatedly cited as actions that reduce the odds of arrest.\n\n3. **Base Rates and Historical Precedent:** The experts uniformly note that the historical base rate for high-profile former officials\u2014especially those with elite status\u2014being arrested over ambiguous political speech is extremely close to zero.\n\n4. **Political Pressure:** Most experts recognize that current political incentives, especially under a hostile Trump administration, marginally increase the risk of an exceptional action (such as arresting Comey) for symbolic, partisan, or deterrent purposes. However, they believe political pressure is unlikely to overwhelm entrenched institutional and legal safeguards absent new, dramatic evidence.\n\n5. **Decision-Making Institutions:** Bureaucratic inertia, prosecutorial independence, concern for public backlash, and risk of institutional/professional consequences all further dampen the odds of a Comey arrest. Arresting a former FBI director on contestable grounds would risk an explosive backlash, severe legal challenge, and further polarization.\n\n6. **Scenario Analysis:** All experts judge a no-arrest outcome as the overwhelming default. Arrest is viewed as plausible only in highly contingent scenarios: sudden emergence of conclusive evidence of intent; radical escalation of political will overriding legal considerations; or an unrelated, unforeseen event.\n\n**Overall**, the expert consensus is that, while the risk is not strictly zero due to elevated political temperature and ongoing investigation, all legal and institutional signals point toward Comey not being arrested before the resolution date. The collective probability estimate is best summarized as 2\u20136%, with virtually all analysis emphasizing the highly unlikely nature of such an arrest barring dramatic, unexpected developments."
