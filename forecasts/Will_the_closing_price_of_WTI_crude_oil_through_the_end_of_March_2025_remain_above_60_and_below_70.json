On March 19, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for April delivery rose by 0.26 dollars (0.39%) to $67.16 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing higher than the previous day. The global benchmark Brent crude oil for May delivery also increased by 0.22 dollars (0.31%) to $70.78 per barrel. The rebound in oil prices was influenced by the escalation of the Middle East crisis, including Israel's resumption of ground warfare in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its interest rate cut schedule twice also had an impact on the price increase. However, the increase in US commercial oil inventories exceeded expectations, limiting the upward momentum of oil prices. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), US commercial oil inventories increased by 1.74 million barrels over the past week, exceeding market expectations of 1.1 million barrels.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:24 PM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8205269)\n\n**US Oil Inventories Up 1.7 Million Barrels Over Week**\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, commercial oil reserves in the US increased by 1.7 million barrels over the week, reaching 437 million barrels as of March 14, 2025.

The prices of Brent and WTI oil futures also saw a slight increase, with Brent up 0.3% at $70.77 per barrel and WTI up 0.3% at $66.95 per barrel. 'The current stock level is 5% below the five-year average typical for this time of the year,' the department added.

The price of gold in New York rose over 1% for the second consecutive day, setting a new historical high. The prices of basic metals on the London Metal Exchange fluctuated on March 18. The Chicago Board of Trade saw a decline in corn, soybean, and wheat futures prices on March 18. The prices of corn, soybean, and wheat futures contracts for May delivery closed at $4.5875 per bushel, $5.65 per bushel, and $10.1275 per bushel, respectively, down 2.25 cents, 3.5 cents, and 2.75 cents from the previous trading day. The market expects that the upcoming inventory and planting reports may show an increase in US corn and soybean planting areas, leading to downward pressure on US soybean and corn prices. Analysts predict that the Chicago agricultural market will continue to experience volatility in the short term. Weather-wise, the US Midwest region is expected to remain warm and dry, which may cause some market disruptions. Additionally, while there are forecasts of rain in the northern winter corn planting area of Brazil, analysts say that the main concern for the 2025 crop yield in South America is still the weather in southern Brazil.

The price of oil lost its earlier gains and returned to Monday's closing levels. As of 18:12 Moscow time, May futures for Brent were trading on the London-based ICE Futures exchange at $71.15 per barrel, up $0.08 (0.1%) from the previous close. April futures for WTI were trading at $67.56 per barrel, down $0.02 (0.03%) from the previous close. Oil prices are receiving support from concerns over the escalation of tensions in the Middle East, which may lead to an increase in transportation costs and enhance the risks associated with supply. Analysts believe that the escalation of tensions may lead to a rise in transportation costs and enhance the risks associated with supply. Fitch, an international rating agency, has downgraded its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 to 2.3% from the previously expected 2.6%. In 2026, global GDP growth may reach 2.2%, according to the agency.

According to the bank, the price of Brent crude oil will decrease to $71 per barrel in December 2025, down from the previous estimate of $76. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is expected to decrease to $67 per barrel. This decrease in oil prices will benefit India as it will get cheaper high-quality crude oil, leading to a decrease in petrol and diesel prices. As per the report, if the oil prices decrease, petrol and diesel prices in India can decrease by up to 10 rupees per liter. This will lead to a decrease in inflation and relief for consumers. However, the government's ability to reduce taxes and implement price cuts will determine the extent of the decrease in petrol and diesel prices.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[punjabkesari](https://www.punjabkesari.in/national/news/prices-of-crude-oil-crude-oil-petrol-prices-diesel-prices-2121332)\n\n**Oil rebounds 1% to end week steady amid prospect of Ukraine ceasefire - The Business Times**\nOil prices rebounded by 1% on Friday, March 14, to end the week nearly unchanged. Brent crude futures settled at $70.58 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) closed at $67.18 a barrel. The rebound was attributed to the prospect of a Ukraine ceasefire, which could bring back Russian energy supplies to Western markets. However, analysts warned that geopolitical tension could still cause supply disruptions and high risks on the demand side argue against a sustained recovery in oil prices. Commerzbank analysts said, 'Brent oil has hovered around the US$70 mark for the past two weeks. Whether it will remain at this level in the coming week depends on the political news situation.' Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, added, 'If the prospect for a ceasefire continues to be pushed into the future, the market would expect Russian oil to be under sanctions for an extended period of time.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[businesstimes.com.sg](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/energy-commodities/oil-rebounds-1-end-week-steady-amid-prospect-ukraine-ceasefire)\n\n**WTI Crude Oil Price Remains Below $70 per Barrel Amid Volatile Fundamentals**\nThe WTI crude oil futures price has been below $70 per barrel since the beginning of the year, with a recent rebound but still maintaining a downward trend. Analysts believe that the supply and demand fundamentals are volatile, making it difficult for the price to have a significant rebound. According to data, the WTI crude oil futures price has been in a downward channel since the beginning of the year, with a recent rebound but still below $70 per barrel. Senior researcher at Galaxy Futures, Tong Chuan, said, 'The macroeconomic environment is weak, and the geopolitical risks have eased, leading to a decline in oil risk premium. The international crude oil price has reached a historical low.' Researcher at Zhongyuan Futures, Wang Ying, believes that the economic downturn trend in overseas markets is unlikely to end soon, and the WTI crude oil price is likely to remain below $70 per barrel. The WTI crude oil futures contract has been trading in a narrow range in recent days, with a closing price of $67.85 per barrel on March 13. Analysts believe that the recent rebound is unlikely to be sustained in the short term due to the supply and demand fundamentals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 01:35 AM\nSource:[\u8d22\u7ecf\u7f51](http://industry.caijing.com.cn/20250314/5076477.shtml)\n\n**WTI Crude Oil Price Decline Slows to $66 per Barrel**\nThe price of WTI crude oil futures has slowed its decline to around $66 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) as of 7:45 Moscow time on March 11. The cost of a barrel of WTI crude oil with April delivery on the NYMEX was $65.9, which is 0.2% lower than the previous day's closing price. In contrast, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures on March 10 decreased by 1.5%, while the day before it increased by 1%. The price of Brent crude oil futures with a May delivery date on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) is $69.3 per barrel, which is in line with previous trading values. The slowdown in the decline in oil prices comes amid China's government introducing new measures to stimulate the economy, as well as market speculators expecting a relaxation of sanctions on the sale of Russian oil.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/401b44c6)\n\n**Chemical Industry Report: International Oil Price Declines, Tariffs Imposed, and Demand for Alternative Energy Sources Increases**\nThe chemical industry report for March highlights several key trends and recommendations. The international oil price has declined, with WTI crude oil futures closing at $67.04 per barrel, down 3.90% from the previous week. The Brent crude oil futures price also declined, closing at $70.36 per barrel, down 3.85% from the previous week. The US has imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective March 9, and has increased the tariff on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. The European Union has announced plans to reduce its dependence on Russian oil, which could lead to a surge in demand for alternative energy sources. The report also notes that the US has seen a significant increase in oil production, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting that oil production reached a record high of 134.9 million barrels per day in December 2024. The report recommends investing in companies that are well-positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for alternative energy sources, such as China Petroleum, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and Sinopec. Additionally, the report suggests that investors should consider companies that are involved in the production of electronic materials, new energy materials, and other emerging industries. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 03:13 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://data.eastmoney.com/report/zw_industry.jshtml?infocode=AP202503091644213557)\n\n**Oil Price Outlook for 2025: A Moderate Recovery**\nThe Brent crude oil futures price averaged $75.0 per barrel in February 2025, down 3.4 dollars per barrel from the previous month, closing at $73.2 per barrel. The WTI crude oil futures price averaged $71.0 per barrel, down 4.2 dollars per barrel from the previous month, closing at $70.0 per barrel. The OPEC+ maintained its current oil production plan unchanged in early February, while the US-China trade tensions and Trump's call to increase US oil production put downward pressure on international oil prices. However, the US sanctions on Iran and the previous sanctions on Russian oil showed their effects, and international oil prices rebounded. Later, the US oil inventory accumulated, and the US and Russia negotiated to end the conflict, and international oil prices fell again. In late February, the flow of Russian oil pipelines decreased due to attacks, and the market worried about the potential disruption of US-Russia supply, while the US product oil inventory decreased, supporting international oil prices. However, the market was concerned about the progress of the US-Russia peace agreement, Iraq's plan to restart Kurdish oil exports, and the US's plan to implement tariffs on Mexico, as well as the decline in US consumer confidence, which exacerbated concerns about slowing demand, and international oil prices fell. Our view is that with the global easing cycle opening up, the global economy is continuously recovering, and oil demand is recovering moderately. The OPEC+ continues to maintain a high level of production cuts, considering the high fiscal balance oil price cost of OPEC+ and the high new well cost of US shale oil, and oil prices are expected to continue to maintain a medium-high range. We predict that the 2025 Brent oil price will be centered at $65-75 per barrel, and the 2025 WTI oil price will be centered at $60-70 per barrel.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://data.eastmoney.com/report/zw_industry.jshtml?infocode=AP202503071644169987)\n\n**WTI Crude Oil Price Stabilizes at $66 per Barrel**\nThe price of WTI crude oil has stabilized at around $66 per barrel, according to data from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) on March 7, 2025. The price of the April WTI futures contract was $66.3 per barrel, a 0.1% decrease from the previous day's close. This is the third consecutive day that the price has remained above $66 per barrel, reaching a six-month low. The price of Brent crude oil futures with a May delivery date on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London was $69.6 per barrel, a 0.2% increase from the previous day's close. The stabilization of oil prices comes as the US government has delayed the implementation of tariffs on Canadian energy imports. However, market speculators are concerned about a further decline in China's economic indicators and an increase in oil production in OPEC+ countries.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/1788e81b)\n\n**NY Crude Oil Futures Plummet to 1-Year Low Amid US Labor Market Slowdown**\nThe price of Texas light crude oil (WTI) futures in the New York market fell to a one-year and ten-month low on March 5, reaching $65.22 per barrel, a 4% drop from the previous day. The closing price was $66.31 per barrel, a 3% drop from the previous day. The decline was influenced by the release of US employment data on March 5, which fell short of market expectations, and the growing awareness of a slowdown in the US labor market. Additionally, the observation that major oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia will gradually reduce their voluntary production cuts from April also contributed to the decline. WTI prices had fallen by nearly 20% in just two months, from around $80 per barrel in mid-January.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20250306-OYT1T50154/)\n\n**Tariff Delay Strengthens Mexican Peso, Oil Prices Fall Amid Trade Concerns**\nThe delay in tariffs on Mexican autos has strengthened the peso, closing at 20.38 on Wednesday, March 5. This comes after US agencies confirmed that tariffs on the automotive sector will be delayed by a month. The price of WTI crude oil, a reference for the Mexican blend, fell 2.86% to $66.31 per barrel, due to concerns over US protectionist trade policies and an expected increase in oil supply, as OPEC+ is set to increase production on April 1. According to reports, if tariffs are extended throughout 2025, it could lead to an economic contraction, as stated by a rating agency.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 03:18 AM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/dinero/2025/03/06/retraso-en-aranceles-a-autos-fortalece-al-peso-mexicano-cerrando-en-2038-este-miercoles-5-de-marzo/)\n\n**WTI Crude Oil Price Falls Below $66 per Barrel**\nThe price of WTI crude oil has fallen by over 3% today, dropping below $66 per barrel, which would be the lowest closing price since 2021.

The price of Brent crude oil futures with an April delivery date on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (ICE) is $76 per barrel, which is 0.3% lower than the previous day's closing price. The decline in oil prices comes amid the release of data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), which showed an increase in US oil reserves for the past week. Meanwhile, market speculators expect the US government to impose sanctions on Iran.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 05:56 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/2b8e29fe)\n\n**WTI Oil Holds Its Ground, Fearing a Collapse**\nThe hydrocarbon markets are experiencing volatility, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices facing additional pressure. However, WTI is attempting to stabilize and avoid dropping to lower levels. On January 28, 2025, WTI was trading near $73.00 per barrel, with futures for March delivery priced at $73.16 per barrel. Despite a brief 0.01% decline, support was observed near $73.08, while resistance was established at $76.00 per barrel. 'WTI is holding its ground, fearing a collapse,' according to market analysts. The benchmark crude oil in the U.S. is trying to stabilize and avoid further decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[mql5.com](https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/760760)\n\n",

Historically, WTI crude oil prices have experienced periods of stability within certain price bands due to production and geopolitical factors. For instance, from 2010 to 2020, WTI prices often stabilized in certain bands due to OPEC production decisions and global economic conditions. The average price band that persisted in stable periods was often around $50-$70 per barrel. Given this historical pattern, I will set an initial probability of 50%, recognizing that the current economic environment and market conditions will require further adjustment.",
