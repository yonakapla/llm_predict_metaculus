Manus is a new AI model that focuses on practical solutions, unlike its predecessors. According to its creator, Yishao Bi, Manus is not just another chatbot, but a new generation of AI that can perform tasks and produce real results independently. Manus has the ability to perform complex tasks such as browsing, clicking on links, data analysis, and even making purchases and investments on behalf of users. This is similar to other models like 'Cloud' from 'Anthropie' and 'Deep Research' from Chat GPT, but Manus focuses on actual execution, helping users complete tasks rather than just providing recommendations. Manus is currently in its experimental phase, where its capabilities are being tested and potential issues are being identified before its official launch. Despite the hype surrounding Manus, there are growing concerns about data security and privacy, particularly with the increasing tensions between China and the West. The US and European countries have been cautious about Chinese technology, imposing restrictions on Chinese apps like 'TikTok' and 'Huawei' due to cybersecurity concerns. With Manus entering the scene, some predict it will face challenges in global adoption, especially in Western markets with strict regulations on Chinese systems.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[tahiamasr.com](https://www.tahiamasr.com/929426)\n\n**New Chinese AI Program 'Manus' Sparks Interest and Concerns**\nThe Chinese artificial intelligence program 'Manus' has sparked interest among experts in the field, generating limited enthusiasm, disappointment, and concerns about data security.

The program's creator, Yishao Bi, said in a promotional video, 'It's not just another chatbot'. He added, 'It's actually an independent program', stating that 'Manus' provides results, and 'we see it as the next step in human-machine collaboration'. Since the launch of 'Chat GPT' in late 2022, major tech companies and startups have been competing to develop advanced AI assistants. Programs like 'Manus' and 'Chat GPT' have similar capabilities, allowing them to act independently to some extent, replacing users to perform tasks online such as browsing and clicking links, and creating summaries. For example, the 'Cloud' program from 'Anthropi' works with the 'Computer User' setting launched in October, and 'Chat GPT' with the 'Deep Research' feature. As Kyle Wiggers, a journalist at 'TechCrunch', pointed out, AI-powered assistant programs have failed to order food and book a ticket to Japan.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 09:17 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/technology/science-technology/artificial-intelligence/32739)\n\n**Meet 4 of the Chinese AI models upending the market**\nChina's AI scene is heating up, with new models rivaling top US players and rattling the stock market. Manus, an AI agent, is being hailed as the next potential 'DeepSeek moment.' DeepSeek was the first Chinese AI startup to shake up the industry, with its R1 model rivaling top competitors like ChatGPT's o1. Alibaba has become a key player to watch after it open-sourced its QwQ-32B model, which used less data than DeepSeek and sent its stock surging 8%. Tencent's AI chatbot Yuanbao topped China's iOS App Store last week, surpassing DeepSeek as the most downloaded free app. Researchers at Monica said Manus is the world's first fully autonomous AI agent, outperforming OpenAI's Deep Research model on the GAIA benchmark. However, some users questioned whether Manus was built from scratch, and others called it overhyped, citing factual errors and execution failures during tests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 10:11 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ai-models-manus-deepseek-alibaba-tencent-2025-3)\n\n**Manus AI: The New Chinese Intelligent and Autonomous Agent**\nManus AI, a new Chinese intelligent and autonomous agent, has been unveiled in March 2025. This tool is presented as the first agent capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, from start to finish.

At the Chinese New Year's Eve gala, a team of robotic dancers mixed with human performers for a futuristic and impressive show. The robots moved with fluidity and precision, making them the stars of the most important TV event in China. The robots are produced by the Chinese start-up Unitree Robotics, which sees the G1 model as a precursor to mass production. The G1 robot is available for 13,000 euros and is being used by some companies as entertainers at trade shows and advertising events. Beijing's economic planners see robotics as a promising consumer trend. They hope to create a 'disruptive' product like laptops, smartphones, or electric cars, which could potentially be in every household. Unitree's founder, Wang Xingxing, is currently in high favor with the Beijing government, along with Liang Wenfeng, who developed the DeepSeek AI model. KI-chatbots and humanoid robots are seen as particularly effective in highlighting China's ambitions to technological leadership on a global scale. However, two-legged robots are considered impractical due to technical difficulties. For example, a recent 'football tournament' in Shanghai, where robots played a game of soccer, was more like a geriatric game of stand-up football. While robots can be programmed to perform complex movements, adapting to a human opponent with two legs is still a 'next level' challenge.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[boersen-zeitung.de](https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/meinung-analyse/nationalstolze-tanzroboter)\n\n**GPT 4.5 Becomes #1 on Chatbot Arena!**\nOpenAI's GPT-4.5 has become the #1 model on the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard, securing over 3,200+ votes and excelling in Style Control and Multi-Turn interactions.

The company's two key language models, DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek V3, have the potential to not only compete with market leaders like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but also surpass them, while using significantly fewer resources. One of the biggest surprises in the industry is the extremely low prices of these models. According to DeepSeek, the prices of their models are based on the amount of input and output data, with one unit being one million tokens. The input data for V3 is ten times cheaper than for GPT-4o Mini, and twenty times cheaper than for Claude 3 Haiku from Anthropic. The output data for V3 is also cheaper, but still more expensive than for GPT-4o Mini. DeepSeek's model R1 is the most affordable among the most powerful models, with prices that are significantly lower than those of Gemini 1.5 Pro and Nova Pro from Amazon. 'DeepSeek's models can not only compete with other models in terms of price, but also demonstrate high performance, making it difficult to justify the high prices of other providers,' said a spokesperson for DeepSeek. As of now, R1 is ranked first in the 'Style Control' rating on the Chatbot Arena website, alongside ChatGPT-4o and Gemini-Exp-1206.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 06:04 PM\nSource:[itechua.com](https://itechua.com/news/275758)\n\n",
