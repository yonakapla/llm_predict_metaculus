Over the past two decades, a wide variety of teams have secured the highest winning percentage each year, with no team consistently maintaining the top spot due to high competition levels and frequent player changes. Given the competitive nature of the league, it is generally rare for any specific team to finish with the highest winning percentage. The base rate for any given team finishing with the highest record, considering 30 teams in the league, can be estimated at approximately 3% (1/30). However, given that the Oklahoma City Thunder are perceived as favorites to potentially win it all this year, a higher base rate, around 10%, is more reasonable to start with due to current expectations and performance.",
