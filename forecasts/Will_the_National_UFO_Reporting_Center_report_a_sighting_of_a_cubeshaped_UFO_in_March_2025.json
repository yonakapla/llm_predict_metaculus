Some of the notable events include: the alignment of the Moon and the star Polux on March 9, the Moon and the Beehive Cluster on March 10, the Moon and the star Regulus (Heart of the Lion) on March 12. Additionally, there will be a total solar eclipse on March 12, a lunar eclipse on March 14, and a partial solar eclipse on March 29. 'It will be one of the most beautiful sights to observe high in the nights of Ramadan,' said the article. Other notable events include the alignment of the Moon and the star Spica (Alpha Virginis) on March 16, the Moon at its apogee on March 17, and the vernal equinox on March 20. 'The month of March will be filled with a variety of astronomical events that will be worth observing,' said the article.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 08:11 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://m2.youm7.com/story/2025/3/7/%D8%AF%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%83-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3-2025-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84/6908391)\n\n**Letters to the editor - March 7, 2024**\nGalileo Galilei's complaint about philosophers refusing to look through a telescope 400 years ago still rings true today. In a recent speech, a politician highlighted the inequality of knowledge, specifically the existence of UFOs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena), which is deliberately restricted from the public. The pursuit of this subject is essential, as it threatens the existing geopolitical order and could force a re-evaluation of reality. By controlling what people believe is possible, those in power maintain their grip on society. The topic of UFOs expands the realm of possibility, shatters imposed narratives, and reopens the doors of human imagination, allowing people to dream again and question the status quo. If the existence of phenomena outside conventional physics were acknowledged, the consequences would be seismic, including the collapse of the energy industry and the loss of government control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[timesofmalta.com](https://timesofmalta.com/article/letters-editor-march-7-2024.1106136)\n\n**Muu Magazine Explores the Unknown with Special Report on Near-Death Experiencer Takuji Kinoshita**\nOne Publishing has released the April issue of their magazine 'Muu' (Special price: 930 yen). The magazine is known for its in-depth coverage of mysteries and the unknown. The issue features a special report on the life and legacy of Takuji Kinoshita, a renowned near-death experiencer who claimed to have seen the truth about the universe and the future. Kinoshita, who passed away on December 1, 2024, was a comet hunter who discovered many comets and had three near-death experiences. He shared his experiences and insights about the past, future, and the universe, which challenged conventional wisdom and had a significant impact on many people. The issue also explores the possibility of a secret US-developed anti-gravity fighter jet, the TR-3B, and its alleged connection to the mysterious 'Black Manta' sightings. Additionally, it delves into the mystery of the 'Mu Dra' meditation technique and its connection to the 'Mu Dra' cards, as well as the Kennedy assassination and UFO cover-ups, and the alleged reincarnation of a Japanese boy who was a victim of the 9/11 attacks. Other topics include the El Tajin archaeological site in Mexico, the recovery of a mysterious egg-shaped UFO by the military, and the capture of a 'Sprite' phenomenon. 'Muu' is a magazine that explores the unknown and the unexplained, and this issue is no exception.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 05:32 AM\nSource:[\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u914d\u4fe1\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2No.1\uff5cPR TIMES](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000992.000060318.html)\n\n**HSBC CUBE Cardholders Enjoy Exclusive Priority Ticket Purchasing Benefits for Two Major Music Events**\nHSBC CUBE cardholders can enjoy exclusive priority ticket purchasing benefits for two major music events in 2025.

According to Dr. Ashraf Tadros, an astronomy professor at the National Research Institute of Astronomy, these events include the conjunction of the moon with the star Pollux, the conjunction of the moon with the Beehive cluster, and the conjunction of the moon with the star Regulus. Additionally, a total lunar eclipse will be visible in North America, Mexico, Central America, and South America, while a partial solar eclipse will be visible in parts of Africa. The moon will also be in its perigee, making it appear larger in the sky. Furthermore, the planet Neptune will be fully illuminated by the sun, making it visible to the naked eye. Finally, the sun will be at its zenith at noon, resulting in equal day and night lengths. These events are expected to be visible in the evening sky, and are a great opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts to observe and photograph them, provided the sky is clear and free of clouds and haze.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:54 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/3/7/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A9/6908013)\n\n**Primavera 2025: A Celebration of Abstract Art for a Good Cause**\nThe 30th edition of the Primavera art exhibition, organized by the Lions clubs Cholet cit\u00e9 and Cholet Mauges, will take place from March 14 to 23, 2025, at the Saint-Louis theater gallery in Cholet, Maine-et-Loire.

The asteroid, discovered in 2004, has a diameter of approximately 340 meters and will pass within 32,000 kilometers of Earth, a distance less than that of geostationary satellites. This rare event, estimated to occur once every 5,000-10,000 years, will be visible to the naked eye in Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. According to the ESA, the asteroid can be studied in detail by a mission called Ramses, which aims to investigate the effects of gravitational proximity to Earth on the asteroid's structure. This will help develop methods for assessing potential threats from celestial bodies and determining ways to deflect them from our planet. To accelerate development, the ESA has decided to use the Hera probe's architecture, which is currently en route to the double asteroid Didymos. Hera will be accompanied by two mini-satellites (cubesats), which will aid in the research. Similarly, Ramses will receive two companions for a more detailed analysis of Apophis. The first cubesat has already been approved, and it will be created by the company Tyvak, with equipment including '...'. The second cubesat, according to preliminary plans, may be a lander that will allow for surface-level research on Apophis. Despite significant progress, the Ramses mission has not yet received final approval. A decisive meeting of the ESA Council of Ministers to approve the mission is scheduled for November 2025.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 09:56 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/nauka_it/yevropa-gotuye-zond-dlya-zustrichi-z-asteroyidom-yakiy-proyde-nebezpechno-blizko-do-zemli-2781555.html)\n\n**Magnetic Storm on March 6, 2025: Expect a Calm Day**\nA magnetic storm on March 6, 2025, is not expected to cause any significant disruptions. According to the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy of the I\u041a\u0418 RAN, the solar plasma release will pass by Earth, resulting in a stable geomagnetic background with a reading of 3 or less. The solar wind speed is expected to be around 488 kilometers per second. The chances of a magnetic storm are 12%, and the probability of geomagnetic disturbances is 25%. In 63% of cases, the magnetosphere will remain stable. The flare activity index is in the yellow zone at 4.8. Six solar flares were recorded yesterday, with one reaching a class M. 'The main hypothesis is that the solar plasma cloud will pass by Earth,' said the astronomers. 'Initially, its movement was at an angle to our planet, making this scenario likely. However, there is a possibility of a delay due to a reevaluation of the plasma speed.' The current flare situation remains calm, with the most dangerous area on the Sun being the center 4012, which is gradually approaching the Earth-Sun line. There is a high probability of M-level flares in the next two days, but the impact of coronal holes on Earth is excluded until the end of the week.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 03:48 AM\nSource:[inbusiness.kz](https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/magnitnaya-burya-6-marta-2025-goda-zhdat-li-ot-solnca-nepriyatnogo-syurpriza)\n\n**'\u5411\u950b\u800c\u884c' Civil Relay Action Launched to Promote Lei Feng Spirit Among Young People**\nThe '\u5411\u950b\u800c\u884c' (Toward the Vanguard) civil relay action was launched on March 4, 2025, at Zhengzhou No. 18 Middle School.

Jake Barber, a government contractor, claims to have flown helicopters on covert missions to gather alien technology. He described flying 150 feet above an 'egg-shaped' object devoid of any engine or thermal signatures, saying, 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' This is the latest report of UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) that the Pentagon admits they're actively scrutinising - adding this case to 21 others. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 cases of UAP encounters from US authorities, including 272 incidents which occurred prior to 2023 but had never been reported publicly. Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart pointed out that AOIMSG's new director, Dr. Jon T. Kosloski, has very limited power when it comes to revealing government secrets, and that the Pentagon has a history of not being forthcoming about UAPs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 05:19 AM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/pentagon-makes-bombshell-announcement-after-34769838)\n\n**Leaked recording: US Air Force pilot reports UFO over California in 2024**\nA US Air Force pilot reported a UFO sighting in September 2024 while flying a Beechcraft 350 in California.

The AI analysis is based on historical patterns, current data, and simulated scenarios. The AI suggests that the growth of observation infrastructure (high-definition telescopes, advanced satellites, and drones) and the relationship between solar activity and unusual atmospheric behavior may contribute to this increase. Additionally, the data indicates that periods of high solar activity may lead to unidentified aerial phenomena in the coming years, particularly around 2028, as stated by the AI.

Given that December had an unusually high number of such sightings, a more conservative base estimate for March would likely be lower, perhaps around 0.01% to 0.1%, considering reporting variance and rarity.",
