The game's use of Japanese masculine terms to refer to Vivian, contrasted with her use of feminine pronouns and presentation as female, is a notable aspect of its representation. Nintendo has a history of including trans characters in its games, including Birdo in Super Mario Bros. 2 and Nova in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y.

'It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation,' said the report.
