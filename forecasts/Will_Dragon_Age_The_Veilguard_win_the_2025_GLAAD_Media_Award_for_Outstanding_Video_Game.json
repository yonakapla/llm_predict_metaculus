The game's restoration of cut content, including trans representation, has been recognized. In the original release, Vivian, a character, is implied to be a transgender female through dialogue. The game's use of Japanese masculine terms to refer to Vivian, contrasted with her use of feminine pronouns and presentation as female, is a notable aspect of its representation. Nintendo has a history of including trans characters in its games, including Birdo in Super Mario Bros. 2 and Nova in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y. However, some of these representations have been cut from English releases. Another nominee, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, features a canonically transgender character and allows players to explore their gender through dialogue options.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[CBR](https://www.cbr.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-glaad-award/)\n\n**Nintendo Snags A Trans Representation Award Nomination For Fixing A 20-Year Old Problem**\nThe 36th GLAAD Media Awards have nominated several games for their outstanding LGBTQ representation, including Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers a more affirming experience, allowing players to define their character's body, gender, and pronouns separately and incorporating their trans identity into the game's story. Other nominees, such as Sorry We're Closed and Dread Delusion, venture into darker territory with queer characters, while games like Minds Beneath Us and Until Then make gender and sexuality key elements of their stories.

The remake included the original dialogue from the Japanese GameCube release, where Vivian is deliberately misgendered by her sisters. GLAAD, a non-profit organization focused on LGBT+ advocacy, celebrates LGBT+ representation in media through its annual awards. Other nominees include Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which feature LGBT+ relationships and characters. According to a GLAAD study, nearly one in five gamers are members of the LGBT+ community, yet LGBT+ storylines and characters account for less than two percent of all games. 'It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation,' said the report. '72 percent of LGBT+ players said seeing characters matching their gender identity or sexual orientation well-represented made them feel better about themselves,' the report added. '68 percent wished there were more prominent LGBT+ storylines.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 05:16 PM\nSource:[Eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-nominated-for-glaad-award-for-trans-representation-in-paper-mario)\n\n**All 2025 Canadian Game Awards Categories & Nominees**\nThe Canadian Game Awards will celebrate gaming's greatest achievements in 16 categories, including AAA games like Dragon Age: The Veilguard and indie titles like Balatro.
