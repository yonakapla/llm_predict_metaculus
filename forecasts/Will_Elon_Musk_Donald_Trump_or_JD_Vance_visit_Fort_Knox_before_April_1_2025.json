He has control over mass communication (X), global internet infrastructure (Starlink), AI development (xAI), and soon, military robotics through Tesla's Optimus project and SpaceX's growing role in defense contracts. This would lead to the replacement of the U.S. Constitution and the end of real elections. Musk's rise is not a conspiracy, but a planned transition from Trump's populist right to an AI-driven, data-powered post-democratic regime. Figures like Vice President JD Vance have openly embraced a Silicon Valley-infused version of authoritarian governance, and tech-aligned political theorist Curtis Yarvin has argued that the U.S. should be restructured into a corporate monarchy. Musk's control over America's future is not based on votes but on infrastructure, and the greatest threat to his plan comes from the entrenched institutions that currently run the U.S.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 12:55 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@paul.love89/elon-musk-doesnt-care-about-your-tesla-fca74679a3a4)\n\n**UAE's Leadership in AI and Energy Praised by US Vice President JD Vance**\nUS Vice President JD Vance praised the UAE's awareness of the importance of leading in artificial intelligence and energy. He said, 'We are happy to welcome Emirati officials visiting the US this week.' Vance emphasized that the UAE's focus on AI and energy is something that many US allies have overlooked. He stated, 'One of the things they are focusing on is something that unfortunately many of our allies have overlooked, that leading in AI requires leading in energy production.' Vance highlighted the Trump administration's focus on the technology sector, saying, 'The growing influence of technology can reshape the relationship between the US government and major tech companies, and it can affect the fortunes of various sectors, from e-services and social media to emerging AI technologies and cryptocurrencies.' UAE Vice President Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan is visiting the US, meeting with senior US officials and business leaders to discuss ways to strengthen the strategic, economic, and technological partnership between the two countries. During his visit, Sheikh Tahnoon met with US President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Larry Ellison to discuss the latest developments in AI.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/jd-vance-uae-allies-energy-ai-leadership)\n\n**Donald Trump, JD Vance get sworn in: See 2025 presidential inauguration in photos**\nDonald Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States for his second non-consecutive term on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Trump was joined by Vice President-elect JD Vance, who was also sworn in. The inauguration ceremony was attended by a number of notable figures, including former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, as well as business leaders such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Trump's second term as President marks a significant moment in American politics, and the ceremony was seen as a celebration of his return to the White House. 'It is the 60th U.S. presidential inauguration and the second non-consecutive inauguration of Trump as U.S. president,' according to the article. Trump's inauguration was a highly anticipated event, and the ceremony was attended by a large crowd of supporters and dignitaries.

Musk, who has become a senior advisor to Trump and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has praised the president in the past, calling him a 'good man' and saying that they have become best friends. Musk has also donated over $290 million to Trump's campaign and other Republican candidates, making him one of the president's biggest supporters. Trump has reciprocated Musk's praise, describing him as the 'smartest person' he could find. Some have questioned the close relationship between the two, with one social media user commenting, 'You see Elon more than JD Vance lmao.

The astronauts, along with NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, returned to Earth in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule after spending months in space. Williams and Wilmore were initially supposed to return in June 2024, but were stranded due to safety concerns with the Boeing Starliner. President Donald Trump later instructed Elon Musk to accelerate their return, which was successful on Tuesday. The return was met with a heartwarming sight as dolphins surrounded the capsule as it splashed down near the coast of Florida.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 03:57 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/jd-vance-reacts-to-sunita-williams-return-as-spacex-splashdown-delights-viewers-glbs-2695995-2025-03-19)\n\n**Trump Announces Investigation into Fort Knox Gold Reserves**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced plans to investigate the gold reserves at Fort Knox, a military base in Kentucky, amid concerns about a multibillion-dollar scam that has raised questions about the safety of the storage facility. Trump stated, 'We're going to go to Fort Knox, and we're going to check to see if there's any gold there, because maybe someone stole it.' The move comes after businessman Elon Musk publicly questioned the size of the gold reserves and suggested a live broadcast from the storage facility. The investigation is seen by many as linked to the release of previously classified documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which was published by the National Archives. Expert Alexander Sadovnikov believes that the assassination was motivated by Kennedy's attempt to take control of the Federal Reserve System, which is controlled by private bankers. Trump's move is seen as a way to gain leverage over the bankers and the Federal Reserve System, and to address the economic crisis in the US.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/dzen/tramp-reshil-vskryt-fort-noks-gde-zoloto-vsjo-nachalos-s-ubijstva-kennedi_1191743)\n\n**The March 2025 Dumbassery Report**\nIn March 2025, Trump, Musk, JD Vance, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt demonstrated their lack of accountability and disregard for the rule of law. Trump demanded the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg for putting a halt to his mass deportation plan, showing his disregard for the separation of powers. Musk installed Starlink in the White House, raising concerns about national security and conflicts of interest. Vance attempted to bridge the gap between tech billionaires and the MAGA base, while Leavitt, who appeared to be out of her depth, took a swing at diplomacy, but her efforts were likely ineffective. 'It's like forcing a Silicon Valley vegan to share a buffet with a guy who thinks a gas station taquito is fine dining,' said an unnamed source, highlighting the disconnect between the two groups.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/the-left-is-right/the-march-2025-dumbassery-report-4c80580b6a45)\n\n**Elon Musk on X: What Tesla billionaire has posted on March 18 so far**\nElon Musk has posted 19 times on X (formerly Twitter) on March 18, focusing on various topics including the Space Dragon docking at the International Space Station, attacks on Tesla vehicles, and news about the Trump administration. Musk condemned protesters setting fire to Tesla vehicles, saying 'This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong.' He also reposted a clip blaming the Biden administration for abandoning Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore on the International Space Station, a claim the astronauts have denied. Musk shared clips about the Trump administration's immigration policy, including a statement from Vice President JD Vance saying migrant crossings were down 94% and a clip from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt encouraging self-deportation from illegal immigrants. Musk also retweeted a post from the House Committee on Education & The Workforce criticizing diversity, equity and inclusion policies (DEI) on college campuses. His most-liked tweet of the day was a response to a post from Gad Saad, to which Musk replied 'Now.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-x-latest-posts-tweets-update-2046597)\n\n**Canada 'rage room' lets visitors smash Trump, Vance, Musk portraits to release tariff angst**\nA 'rage room' business in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, has introduced a 'Smash the Tariffs' promotion, allowing customers to smash portraits of President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and DOGE leader Elon Musk for $5, with a portion of the proceeds going to a local food bank. The business's owner, Terry LeBlanc, said, 'Normally, I don't really get political. However, I feel with everything going on in the world and what's happening these days... this is needed.' A 14-year-old boy, who smashed a Trump portrait with a baseball bat, said, 'it's about how he's treating this country (Canada).'

The invitation was handed to Mr Trump during a meeting to discuss Ukraine at the end of February. Mr Trump has accepted the offer and expressed his enthusiasm for the visit, calling King Charles a 'beautiful man, a wonderful man'. The visit will likely include Melania Trump, but other potential attendees, such as JD Vance and Elon Musk, are uncertain. Mr Vance has taken an active role in presidential dealings, while Mr Musk has a history of defying convention, but it is unlikely that he will accompany Mr Trump due to his senior advisor role and other commitments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 05:20 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/jd-vance-elon-musk-meet-171116335.html)\n\n**Best video, images of President Trump, Elon Musk's visit to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach**\nPresident Trump visited Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, accompanied by Elon Musk, after delivering remarks at a White House digital assets summit.

Trump said, 'Would anybody like to join us? Because we want to see if the gold is still there.' The audit is a response to Musk's previous announcement that he wants to personally verify the gold reserves, which he believes may be missing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that there is an annual audit and that 'all the gold is present and accounted for.' The visit has been met with skepticism, with some questioning the need for a physical audit. Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who invited Musk to review the gold reserve, said, 'I think some of them may not think it needs to be audited all the time, but I think the more sunlight, the better, more transparency, the better.' The United States has the world's largest gold reserve, with over 8,100 tonnes stored at Fort Knox.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

How that conspiracy theory got started.**\nPresident Trump and Elon Musk plan to visit Fort Knox to verify the presence of the U.S. gold reserves, despite assurances from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that all gold is 'present and accounted for.' Trump said, 'We're going to open up the doors. I'm going to see we have gold there. We want to find out, did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?' Musk had previously expressed skepticism about the gold's existence, writing, 'Maybe it\u2019s there, maybe it\u2019s not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it\u2019s still there.' The current controversy over Fort Knox's gold reserves seems to have started with a tweet by Zero Hedge, which asked Musk to 'take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there.' The last official audit of the gold was conducted in 1974, and due to security measures, audits do little to satisfy conspiracy theorists. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, 'I can tell the American people on camera right now, there was a report, September 30th, 2024, all the gold is there. Any U.S. senator who wants to come and visit it can arrange a visit through our office.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 10:52 PM\nSource:[finance.yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-and-elon-musk-will-go-to-fort-knox-to-make-sure-no-one-stole-us-gold-how-that-conspiracy-theory-got-started-225218892.html)\n\n**Trump and Musk to Visit Fort Knox to Verify Gold Reserves**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that he and Elon Musk will visit Fort Knox to verify if the gold is actually stored there. Fort Knox has been the official repository of the majority of the US's gold reserves since the 1930s, and is heavily guarded. Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated, 'Annual audits are conducted, and all gold has been confirmed.' However, Trump declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 'We will also go to Fort Knox. We will go with Elon.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 04:55 AM\nSource:[goo blog](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/etjapan/e/78e7807f98df360764112d958b78a785)\n\n**Trump Promises to Forge a New Majority at CPAC 2025**\nThe 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) brought together international guests such as Argentine President Javier Milei, Polish President Andrzej Duda, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. On Thursday, the CPAC focused on its inaugural day with presentations by Vice President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk, who was designated by Trump to reduce federal spending through his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk appeared on stage wielding the 'democracy chainsaw' that Milei had given him earlier. The day before, Trump closed the conservative gathering, boasting in his speech on Saturday of the results of his agenda in his first month in office, claiming to 'dominate' Washington and send bureaucrats 'packing'. Trump promised attendees that he would forge a new and lasting political majority that would drive American politics for generations and repeated that voters gave him a mandate to reform the government. He announced plans to toughen his immigration policy with stricter measures, defended mass layoffs of federal employees, and said that the US Agency for International Development (USAID) would be taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. Trump also mentioned that the USAID name was removed from its old building and repeated his previous promises to examine the country's gold reserve in Fort Knox, Kentucky. Trump did not miss the opportunity to mock his predecessor Joe Biden and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, mispronouncing her name. The closing program included interventions by Milei, Meloni, and Tom Homan, the 'border czar' appointed by the White House, who directly addressed the immigration policies implemented by the new US government. Milei, a frequent guest at CPAC events, said, 'My method is similar to that of our dear friend Elon Musk (...) going office by office, keeping what works and getting rid of the rest. That's why I gave him a chainsaw.' Other speakers included Dan Scavino, Trump's deputy chief of staff; Stephen Miller, a White House advisor; and Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/02/23/eeuu-mas-a-la-derecha/)\n\n**Trump again vows Fort Knox visit to see if gold is \u2018still there\u2019**\nFormer President Trump announced at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he plans to visit Fort Knox with tech billionaire Elon Musk to check if the gold reserves are 'still there.'

Despite Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's assurance that all the gold is accounted for, Trump and Musk are interested in verifying the gold reserves. Bessent stated, 'We do an audit every year.

Now, gold is the focus. The price of gold has risen sharply in 2025, surpassing major stock market indices. The price of $3,000 per ounce is within reach. Due to high demand for physical gold, gold bars are being shipped across the Atlantic daily. The financial blog 'Zerohedge' is questioning whether the US Federal Reserve's kilobarrels of gold are actually stored in Fort Knox. The blog's author, 'It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there', as the last audit was 50 years ago in 1974. Elon Musk responded, 'Surely it\u2019s reviewed at least every year?' Senator Rand Paul chimed in, 'Nope. Let\u2019s do it.' The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also has a significant gold reserve, but refuses to disclose its location, stating that a portion of it is stored abroad. It is assumed that this refers to the US. The SNB's gold reserve has been halved in the past, and it is unclear what would happen to US stocks in the AHV fund in the event of an extreme scenario.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:41 AM\nSource:[insideparadeplatz.ch](https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2025/02/17/gold-im-rausch-ist-es-greifbar/)\n\n**Trump to host 'Victory Rally' with Musk, Vance ahead of inauguration: Time, where to watch, all you need to know**\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is set to hold a 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' in Washington, DC, on January 19, 2025, a day before his inauguration.

After the second phase, where experts reviewed news articles confirming plans by Trump and Musk to visit, revised probabilities increased significantly, ranging from 30% to 90%. The consensus suggests a much higher likelihood of the visit occurring before April 1, 2025, primarily driven by public announcements and planned visits by Trump and Musk.",
