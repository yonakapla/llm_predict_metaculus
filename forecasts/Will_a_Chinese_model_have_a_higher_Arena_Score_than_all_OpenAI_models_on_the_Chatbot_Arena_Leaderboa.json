Its R1 model, an open-source solution, combines efficiency and accessibility without precedent. Launched on January 10, 2025, DeepSeek R1 offers performance comparable to OpenAI's advanced models, but at no cost, making it a game-changer for millions of users and developers. In contrast, OpenAI charges up to $200 per month for its premium subscription models. DeepSeek's success in the US market is a milestone, with its R1 model ranked as the third most powerful globally, according to Chatbot Arena, a project developed by the University of California, Berkeley. Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California, notes that US restrictions on exporting advanced chips may be 'fostering innovation in China' by forcing companies to optimize their resources. DeepSeek's R1 model, developed in just two months, is a clear example of how efficiency can compensate for a lack of computational resources. The company's success has also sent shockwaves through financial markets, with companies like Nvidia and Oracle experiencing significant declines in their stock values, and the Nasdaq 100 experiencing its largest drop since 2022. As Marc Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, noted, this development is reminiscent of the 'Sputnik moment' in the space race.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/mundo/2025/01/27/asi-es-deepseek-la-inteligencia-artificial-china-que-supero-a-chatgpt-con-funciones-premium-gratuitas-y-alto-rendimiento-lrchn-754785)\n\n",
