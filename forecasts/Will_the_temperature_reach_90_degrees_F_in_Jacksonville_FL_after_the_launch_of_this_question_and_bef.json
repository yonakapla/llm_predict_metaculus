A brush fire in southern Miami-Dade has forced the closure of Card Sound Road, and the wind will play a role in determining where the smoke will move. Rain is not expected to help with the containment of the fire, and it will be mainly dry and sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 80s. There is a moderate risk of rip currents along the Atlantic beaches. Thursday will be the warmest day of the week, with highs in the mid 80s, but it will be breezy. The weekend will be warmer, with highs in the low 80s, and early next week the chance of rain increases with spotty showers on Monday and scattered showers on Tuesday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/mostly-sunny-and-dry-across-south-florida/)\n\n**Vilfand Predicts Up to 14 Degrees Celsius in Moscow Next Week**\nRoman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, has predicted that the temperature in Moscow may reach up to 14 degrees Celsius next week. 'The temperature will be above 10 degrees Celsius on March 23 and 24, with daytime temperatures ranging from +6 to +11 degrees Celsius. It will be sunny due to high pressure, and the air masses will be moving from the south,' Vilfand said. He added that on March 25, daytime temperatures are expected to range from +9 to +14 degrees Celsius, with mostly clear skies and little precipitation. 'There will be plenty of sunshine in the coming days, and if you stand outside for an hour, you might even get a sunburn,' Vilfand concluded. This comes after Tatyana Pozdnyakova, the chief specialist at the Moscow Meteorological Bureau, predicted that April will be 3 degrees warmer than normal in Moscow. Vilfand also previously stated that spring 2025 temperatures will be within or slightly below normal, and that the winter of 2024-2025 was the second warmest on record.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1856652/2025-03-19/vilfand-sprognoziroval-do-14-gradusov-tepla-v-moskve-na-sleduiushchei-nedele)\n\n**Russia's April Weather Forecast: Warmer Than Usual**\nAccording to a forecast by Moscow's meteorological office, temperatures in the Central Federal District (CFO) are expected to be three degrees warmer than usual. As meteorologist Tatyana Pozdnyakova said, 'This means that the average monthly air temperature will exceed 10 degrees Celsius. April 2025 will have a similar air temperature to April 2024.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 07:26 AM\nSource:[RZN.info](https://www.rzn.info/news/2025/3/19/rossiyanam-dali-prognoz-aprelskoj-pogody-v-cfo-313899.html)\n\n**April in Moscow to be Abnormally Warm, Says Meteorologist Tatyana Podynyakova**\nAccording to meteorologist Tatyana Podynyakova, April in Moscow will be abnormally warm, with a mean monthly temperature above +10\u00b0C. 'All seasonal weather forecast models are unanimous in their calculations: a positive temperature anomaly will persist in April, averaging around +3\u00b0C. This means that the mean monthly temperature will exceed +10\u00b0C,' she wrote in her Telegram channel. Podynyakova notes that April this year will be similar to April 2024 in terms of temperature. However, the forecast for precipitation is uncertain, with both a deficit and an excess being equally likely. Last year, April saw an excess of precipitation, with 37 mm of normal precipitation exceeded by 130-150%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/03/19/reg-cfo/sinoptik-pozdniakova-v-aprele-anomalno-teplaia-pogoda-v-moskve-sohranitsia.html)\n\n**Dante Ricci: Cold returns after taste of spring**\nPutnam County can expect a cold return after a taste of spring, with gusty north winds and chances of snow showers on Thursday. The cooler pattern will continue on Friday with abundant sunshine and breezy west winds. Temperatures will struggle to reach the 50s, and a light jacket will still be needed for the weekend. Rain chances return on Saturday, with highs in the 60s ahead of a cold front. The long-range pattern signals a return to colder air and below-normal temperatures in April, with a rollercoaster effect continuing in the region.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[The Herald-Dispatch](https://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/putnam_news/dante-ricci-cold-returns-after-taste-of-spring/article_c9346e78-029a-11f0-9364-d73a8b4c5c6a.html)\n\n**Possible First Summer Day of 2025: Temperatures to Reach Up to 25 Degrees Celsius**\nA meteorologist, Dominik Jung, predicts that it could be the first summer day of the year 2025 on Friday, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celsius. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), a summer day is defined as a day with a minimum air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Jung says that it will be unusually warm for the season, with temperatures in the west and southwest reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius, and locally even warmer. In the east, temperatures will reach up to 21 degrees Celsius, and in the north, up to 18 degrees Celsius. Jung also notes that the sun will shine brightly throughout the country, with 10-12 hours of sunshine per day. However, a high-pressure system called 'Konstantina' will bring Saharan dust to the country, which may cloud the sky in the west on Friday. Despite this, temperatures are expected to remain warm over the weekend, with values of 15-22 degrees Celsius predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Jung notes that it is still unclear how the weather will develop in April and May, and that cold air masses may still occur.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[T-online.de](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/wetter/id_100641434/wetter-bis-zu-25-grad-diese-woche-erster-sommertag-moeglich.html)\n\n**Tomsk to Experience a Short Warmth Before a Cold Snap**\nAccording to Gismeteo, Tomsk can expect temperatures to rise to +10 degrees Celsius on March 19-20, 2025, with the air warming up to 16:00. The next two days are expected to be sunny, but a small rain is forecasted for the night of March 18-19.

This will lead to an early awakening of nature and infrastructure in the region. While the early warmth brings pleasant prospects, it may also have negative consequences, such as early tree blooming, which can cause problems for people with allergies, and an increase in forest fires due to dry soil. However, for gardeners, this will be a welcome gift, as the long-awaited dacha season will start much earlier. For people with weather-related health issues, the rapid temperature fluctuations may pose a significant challenge. As a result, it is essential to be prepared for the unusual consequences of this early summer. This spring once again highlights the global climate changes that have affected even our familiar weather patterns.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[ngzt.ru](https://ngzt.ru/news/anomalnaya-zhara-nagryanet-v-aprele-leto-nastupit-na-dva-mesyaca-ranshe-rasskazal-sinoptik/)\n\n**FIRST ALERT WEATHER: Beautiful St. Patrick\u2019s Day \ud83c\udf40**\nThis St. Patrick's Day in Jacksonville, Florida, is expected to be beautiful with full sunshine and highs in the 60s.

In phase 2, experts adjusted their probabilities slightly, with most increasing or maintaining their estimates due to ongoing warming trends, though still noting the absence of direct forecasts predicting 90\u00b0F temperatures. Revised probabilities after phase 2 ranged from 10% to 40%, reflecting a cautious expectation of warming but no definitive prediction of reaching 90\u00b0F before the specified date.",
