He added that the UK will do everything to restore the ceasefire, release the remaining prisoners, and deliver urgent aid. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy previously accused Israel of violating international law by blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, saying, 'This is a violation of international law. Israel has the right to ensure its own security, but the last aid to enter Gaza was 15 days ago. The lack of aid is unacceptable.' Starmer also mentioned that he had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the previous night, discussing the ceasefire process led by US President Donald Trump with Russia.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/ingiliz-lider-israili-sucladi-saldirilarinda-sok-oldugunu-soyledi-birlesik-kralliktan-aciklandi-1921941.html)\n\n**Starmer refuses to rule out extending stealth raid on income tax**\nSir Keir Starmer refused to rule out extending a freeze on income tax thresholds, which is widely viewed as a 'stealth tax'.

The Labour leader was grilled by Kemi Badenoch over the Government's welfare reforms, including a \u00a35 billion cut to benefits. Starmer defended the reforms, saying the current benefits system is 'morally and economically indefensible'. He also revealed that he is watching the Netflix drama 'Adolescence' with his children to provide them with better role models. The Prime Minister's Questions session also touched on issues such as youth homelessness, the SNP's record on the issue, and the resumption of Israeli military action in Gaza.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-refuses-rule-extending-stealth-143152400.html)\n\n**Starmer: I am deeply concerned about Israel's renewed attacks on Gaza**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed great concern over Israel's renewed attacks on Gaza, stating, 'The images of parents carrying their children to the hospital over the past few days and the number of people being killed are truly shocking.'

Starmer has had his best weeks in office, positioning himself as a leader in European diplomacy during the Ukraine crisis. However, his domestic policy is causing controversy, particularly with the announcement of a plan to cut social benefits for disabled people. The plan, which will make it harder for people to receive the Personal Independence Payment and reduce the age limit for claiming disability benefits, is a cost-cutting measure aimed at reducing social spending by \u00a35 billion by 2020. According to Labour Minister Elizabeth Kendall, the reform will 'facilitate integration into the labor market', but critics argue that it will harm vulnerable groups. Starmer's approval ratings have risen, but his social policy is now facing opposition from within his own party. As Kendall said, 'It was a great day' for the government's economic plans, but for many, it's a step in the wrong direction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:33 PM\nSource:[Die Presse](https://www.diepresse.com/19485125/starmer-bringt-mit-sparkurs-den-linken-parteifluegel-gegen-sich-auf)\n\n**UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Increased Support for Ukraine: A Shift in Global Politics**\nAccording to Egor Chernyev, the head of the VR delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a key global reason is driving the UK to increasingly support Ukraine.

Starmer stated, 'Two sovereign allies with so much in common, shared history, shared values, shared monarch', after saying it was 'fantastic' to receive Carney at 10 Downing Street just days after he took office on Friday. Starmer thanked Carney for his 'approach' to Ukraine, after participating in a virtual summit on Saturday to coordinate with the European country in the face of the diplomatic turmoil triggered by US President Donald Trump.

According to JL Partners co-founder Tum Lubbock, 'Keir Starmer is in a race for popularity with Nigel Farage, and at the moment, this data shows that Nigel Farage is the preferred choice for Prime Minister in more than half of constituencies vs the Prime Minister.' The poll also found that over 50% of British voters see the Labour Party as 'anti-fun' and opposed to personal liberties. Director of public affairs at the Adam Smith Institute, Maxwell Marlow, said, 'This should be a wake up call for Starmer and co.

However, Starmer's approval ratings at home are also in decline due to controversies such as axing a winter fuel repayment program and policy reversals on political donations. According to Colin Brazier, Starmer's approval ratings have 'fallen faster than almost any previous incumbent' due to new taxes and a sense of 'undeveloping' Britain. Despite this, Alan Mendoza, Executive Director of the Henry Jackson Society, believes that the meeting could be an opportunity for Starmer to gain points at home while soothing diplomatic ties. Mendoza pointed to the successful meeting between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron as an indicator of how Starmer's discussions could go. The meeting is expected to address topics such as U.S.-U.K. defense alliances, support for Ukraine, and shared economic and trade-based partnerships.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 09:12 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/uks-starmer-juggles-trouble-at-home-he-walks-geopolitical-tightrope-trump)\n\n**Keir is less popular than every PM of last 5 decades  --  apart from Truss**\nA YouGov poll has found that Sir Keir Starmer is less popular than every Prime Minister of the last five decades, except for Liz Truss.

Ishiba's efforts to boost his approval ratings may be seen as a positive step towards his leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 10:38 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/japan-pm-ishibas-approval-rate-rises-5-points-44-nhk-poll-shows-2025-02-10/)\n\n**Nightmare for Keir Starmer as Government approval rating slumps to record low**\nAccording to a new YouGov poll, the UK Government's approval rating has reached a record low, with 64% of respondents disapproving of their record. This is the highest disapproval rate since the general election last year. Experts note that the proportion of those who approve of Sir Keir Starmer's administration is 16%, a 4% decrease from January 18-20. The net approval rating is -48. This comes as the Prime Minister and Chancellor aim to boost economic growth this week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2006859/nightmare-starmer-approval-rating)\n\n**Starmer ends a disastrous week with his most ridiculous pledge yet**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to remain in office for 10 years, despite his rapidly declining popularity. According to a recent poll, 64% of Britons have a negative opinion of Starmer, with 40% calling for him to resign as Labour leader. The Labour Party's approval rating has dropped to 27%, with the Reform party gaining ground. Starmer's decision to cut benefits for disabled people has been met with widespread criticism, with many accusing him of being 'ruthless' and 'heartless'. The Prime Minister's approval rating has hit a new low, with only 24% of people thinking he is doing a good job. The article concludes that Starmer's chances of winning another election are slim, and that he may face serious talk of resignation if the local elections go badly this year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 11:34 AM\nSource:[thecanary.co](https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/starmer-new-policy/)\n\n",

Historically, Japanese Prime Ministers tend to have approval ratings that fluctuate significantly due to political stability and economic policy outcomes. For UK Prime Ministers, approval ratings often correlate with economic performance, political controversies, and party support dynamics. Given a baseline comparison of historical approval ratings, it can be observed that UK Prime Ministers often dwell within a mid-range (~40-50%), while Japanese Prime Ministers frequently experience broader swings (~30-60%). Considering the recent data from January 2025 and these historical trends, I estimate an initial probability of 50% for Keir Starmer having a higher rating than Shiguru Ishiba.",

In recent years, UK Prime Ministers have often had varying approval ratings, influenced by economic and political factors, while Japanese Prime Ministers have generally maintained more stable ratings. Based on past data from Morning Consult's Global Leader Approval survey and considering both countries' political contexts from 2019 to 2024, there is a slight tendency for Japanese Prime Ministers to have relatively steady and, on average, slightly higher approval ratings. As a rough estimate, I would place the initial probability of Keir Starmer having a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba at approximately 40%.",

    "summary": "After reviewing the initial and revised analyses of multiple experts, the consensus is that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is unlikely to have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on April 1, 2025. In Phase 1, initial probabilities varied, but many experts estimated around a 40-70% chance in favor of Starmer having a higher rating due to factors like recent diplomatic efforts and UK domestic policies. However, in Phase 2, after considering recent news and polling data, most experts adjusted their probabilities downward, typically landing around 40-60%. This revision was due to the significant domestic challenges and criticisms Starmer faced, despite his improved international standing, while Ishiba's approval rating increased to 44%. The most common revised probability settled around 40-60%, indicating a lower confidence in Starmer surpassing Ishiba in approval ratings.",
