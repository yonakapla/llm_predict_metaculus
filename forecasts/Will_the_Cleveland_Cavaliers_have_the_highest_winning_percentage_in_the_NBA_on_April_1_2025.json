Despite this, the team remains confident, having proven they can win tough games without Mitchell. With De'Andre Hunter expected to return to the lineup, the Cavs will have some reinforcements as they take on the Memphis Grizzlies. The game's availability could decide the Defensive Player of the Year award, with Evan Mobley and Jaren Jackson Jr. facing off in a marquee showdown. Mobley has been vocal about his goals this season, including winning Defensive Player of the Year, and this game could serve as his opportunity to cement his claim as the league's best defender.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 08:02 PM\nSource:[ClutchPoints](https://clutchpoints.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/cavs-news-cleveland-winning-streak-donovan-mitchell)\n\n**Nikola Jokic Returns to the Top of the MVP Hunt**\nThe NBA has updated the 'MVP Hunt' for the 2024/25 season.

Editorial**\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are dominating the NBA, with a 55-10 record and a 15-game winning streak. They are the first team to secure a guaranteed spot in the playoffs and have the best record in the league. The team's depth, led by head coach Kenny Atkinson, has been praised by sports columnist Jason Gay, who wrote, 'The Cleveland Cavaliers may be the best basketball team on Earth (right now)'. The team's offense is league-leading, with 122.7 points per game, and they have demonstrated phenomenal firepower and chemistry on the court. The Cavaliers are on pace to win 69 games, which would give them one of the top regular-season marks in NBA history.

Despite missing three key players, the Cavaliers have consistently found ways to win, thanks to their defensive efforts and never-say-die attitude. Memphis, who have won four straight, will try to play spoiler, but have struggled to maintain leads in recent games. As Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, 'I'm aware of our inability right now to stretch leads.' Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson praised his team's clutch player, Darius Garland, who has consistently delivered in the fourth quarter. Atkinson said, 'Darius is the clutch player of the year. He just does it in the fourth quarter. He's done it all year.' The Cavaliers' winning streak is a testament to their depth, grit, and resiliency, as coach Atkinson noted, 'It's really quite an accomplishment. We'll look back at this and say this was some kind of an accomplishment.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 05:38 AM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/basketball/cleveland-cavaliers-go-for-franchise-record-16th-straight-win-in-matchup-versus-memphis-grizzlies)\n\n**Cavaliers vs. Grizzlies prediction, odds, pick, spread - 3/14/2025**\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers (55-10) are visiting the Memphis Grizzlies (42-24) in a cross-conference matchup.

Donovan Mitchell is leading the Cavaliers with one of the best seasons of his career, while Evan Mobley has emerged as a star. The Cavaliers are leading the league in scoring with 122.7 PPG and are shooting a league-best 39% from beyond the arc. The Grizzlies are also a high-scoring team, leading the league with 122.6 PPG. Jaren Jackson Jr.'s status is still 'questionable' and his availability will be crucial to the Grizzlies' success. The Cavaliers have gone 41-23-1 ATS this season, while the Grizzlies are 36-29 ATS.

Following phase 2, where experts reviewed recent news articles, the revised probabilities ranged from 20% to 45%. The experts unanimously recognized the Cavaliers' impressive 15-game winning streak and their 55-10 record as the best in the league. However, they also noted the challenges posed by Donovan Mitchell's injury and upcoming games against strong teams like the Memphis Grizzlies. Overall, the revised probabilities reflected increased confidence in the Cavaliers maintaining a high winning percentage, despite the injury concerns and competitive challenges.",
