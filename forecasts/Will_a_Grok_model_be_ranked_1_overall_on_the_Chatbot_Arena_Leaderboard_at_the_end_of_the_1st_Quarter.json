The researchers queried eight chatbots with article excerpts and found that they returned wrong answers to over 60% of the queries. The chatbots, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, 'returned wrong answers with alarming confidence,' tending not to qualify their results or admit to knowledge gaps. Even premium models like Grok-3 Search and Perplexity Pro answered more correctly than free versions, but still gave wrong answers more confidently. The report concludes that AI tools mis-crediting sources or incorrectly representing their work could backfire on the publishers' reputations and that original reporting is still a more reliable news source than what AI tools regurgitate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/even-premium-ai-tools-distort-the-news-and-fabricate-links-these-are-the-worst/)\n\n**Google Releases Gemma 3 Series of Models, a Single-GPU Model with High Performance**\nGoogle has released the Gemma 3 series of models, which are the most advanced, portable, and responsible open-source models developed by Google.

According to NewsGuard, the Russian network 'Pravda' published over 3.6 million articles in 2024, which were integrated into large AI models such as ChatGPT, Grok from xAI, and Microsoft Copilot. The study found that in 33.55% of cases, AI chatbots repeated the information, in 48.22% of cases they denied it, and in 18.22% of cases they avoided a specific answer. NewsGuard accused 'Pravda' of intentionally inserting false facts to mislead AI, which draws information in real-time. The company made this conclusion after finding that several chatbots repeated a false claim about the ban of Truth Social in Ukraine, although the platform was never launched there. Six out of ten chatbots accepted this claim as a fact and even cited articles from 'Pravda'. This raises serious concerns about the accuracy of information and its presentation. People increasingly rely on AI summaries, which do not always correctly verify facts, creating a risk of manipulating public opinion, considering the influence of AI model owners.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:36 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/52e9bb3c)\n\n**Grok 3: The Future of AI Chatbots or Just Another Hype?**\nGrok 3, developed by xAI, is a strong competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
