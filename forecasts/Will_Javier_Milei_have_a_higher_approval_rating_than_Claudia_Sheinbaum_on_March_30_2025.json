This is based on a survey of over 2,000 cases in the first days of March. Milei's positive image rating fell by six points compared to the previous measurement, while his negative image rating increased by 7 points. 'In March, a pronounced deterioration in the image credentials of both Javier Milei and other figures of the officialism is observed,' Opina Argentina details in its report. This is also seen in the cases of Patricia Bullrich (-6.47%), Victoria Villarruel (-1.45%), and Minister of Economy Luis 'Toto' Caputo (-6.44%), where positive ratings fell, but negative ratings increased. Milei's situation is the most paradoxical, as his negative image rating increased by 7 points compared to February, but he still has a 32% 'very positive' rating, 16% 'somewhat positive', against a 47% 'somewhat negative' and 5% 'very negative' rating. According to Opina Argentina's survey, March is the first month since November when the president's negative image rating surpasses his positive image rating.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 12:10 AM\nSource:[eldiariodelapampa.com.ar](https://www.eldiariodelapampa.com.ar/pais/51727/crecio-la-imagen-negativa-de-milei)\n\n**Argentina's Failure to Attract Investment: A Contrast with Mexico's Success**\nArgentina's President Javier Milei has failed to attract significant foreign investment, despite his promises to turn the country into a 'Hub tecnol\u00c3\u00b3gico'. In contrast, Mexico has seen a surge in investment, particularly in the technology sector, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alibaba Group announcing major investments. Mexico's government, led by Claudia Scheinbaum, has also attracted more investment than Argentina in over a year of Milei's presidency. 'Voy a convertir a Argentina en un Hub tecnol\u00c3\u00b3gico', Milei said after his return from Silicon Valley in June last year. However, his efforts have been limited to participating in a cryptocurrency scam. Meanwhile, Mexico has successfully attracted Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, who announced the opening of a new gigaplant in the country in 2023, with an investment of $4.5 billion. 'El gobierno de izquierda de M\u00c3xico ha logrado capturar mayores inversiones que Milei en m\u00c3\u00a1s de un a\u00c3\u00b1o de mandato', said a source.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 10:06 PM\nSource:[La Pol\u00edtica Online](https://www.lapoliticaonline.com/economia/argentina-frente-a-mexico-sheinbaum-recibe-las-inversiones-tecnologicas-que-esquivan-a-milei/)\n\n**Sheinbaum's 'Arancel-Fest': A Move to Consolidate Internal Support**\nAnalysts 'applaud' Sheinbaum for 'Arancel-Fest': 'It's an act thought for internal politics.' Specialists considered that with the assembly to inform about the agreement with Trump to pause the tariffs, President Sheinbaum will strengthen her image. Sheinbaum decided to call the 'Arancel-Fest' with musical groups in the Z\u00f3calo of CDMX, after President Trump paused for the second consecutive month the general tariffs of 25% for Mexican products. Although analysts estimate that the festival in the Z\u00f3calo will not alleviate the climate of uncertainty that threatens new investments and the Mexican economy, it will help Sheinbaum to consolidate internal support against Trump, who with his powerful rhetoric is setting the pace for bilateral relations. 'This is an act thought more for internal politics,' said the political scientist and academic Javier Rosiles Salas, who stated that with the event on Sunday, March 9, Sheinbaum seeks to strengthen her image and leadership. According to Rosiles Salas, despite the concerns in Mexico about the economic impacts that a tariffs war with the US could trigger, the confrontation with Trump has been 'very beneficial to the figure of Claudia Sheinbaum' and has allowed her to reach a popular support of over 60% five months after she began her sexenio. In fact, in the latest survey by El Financiero, Sheinbaum appears with 85% approval, the highest for a Mexican president in at least the last 30 years. However, it is unclear if her political support could weaken in the event of a deterioration of the Mexican economy due to tensions with the US.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/2025/03/09/festival-de-claudia-sheinbaum-en-zocalo-analistas-dicen-que-fortalece-su-imagen/)\n\n**Mexican President Sheinbaum Focuses on Domestic Politics Amid US-Mexico Tensions**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has decided to focus on domestic politics after a tumultuous week in US-Mexico relations. She has called for a mass rally and music festival in Mexico City's main square on Sunday, following US President Donald Trump's decision to suspend tariffs on Mexican products for the second month in a row. Initially, Sheinbaum had planned to hold a protest in the capital's main square to announce retaliatory measures against the US, but changed her plans after the tariff delay. According to analyst Javier Rosiles Salas, the event will help Sheinbaum consolidate her internal support and strengthen her image and leadership. 'This is an act more focused on internal politics,' Rosiles Salas said. Despite concerns about the economic impacts of a trade war with the US, Sheinbaum's confrontation with Trump has been 'very beneficial to her image' and has allowed her to maintain a popularity rating above 60% five months into her presidency. However, it is unclear whether her support will wane if the economy deteriorates due to tensions with the US. Experts and rating agencies project that a potential imposition of tariffs could lead to a contraction of over 1% of Mexico's GDP.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-eeuu-aranceles-trump-cb03538cf1611f7bf415b9ec07658ff1)\n\n**Latin American Women Demand Equality and Protection on International Women's Day**\nOn International Women's Day, thousands of women across Latin America took to the streets to demand equality, protection from violence, and a life free from fear. In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum promised to implement constitutional and legal reforms to end violence against women, but protesters accused her of not listening to their demands and trying to silence them. The main demand of Mexican women this year was that the number of women killed in 2024, including 839 by femicide, not reach the 3,400 mark. In Brazil, women protested to defend the right to abortion, which is already limited, and in Colombia, they demanded a life free from violence. In Venezuela, women marched for better salaries, shelters for victims of gender violence, and the legalization of safe and free abortion. In Argentina, women protested against the government of Javier Milei, calling for a transfeminist, antifascist, and antiracist movement. In Ecuador, thousands of women marched against the increase in violence and the threat of losing rights. In Peru, women protested against the government's plan to merge the ministries of Women and Social Development, and in the United States, women marched against the government of Donald Trump, calling him 'fascist'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 05:32 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/es/marchas-8m-en-latinoam%C3%A9rica-exigen-igualdad-y-protecci%C3%B3n/a-71871027)\n\n**Latin American Women Unite Against Patriarchy and Far-Right Wave**\nTens of thousands of women and LGTBIQ+ people took to the streets in major cities across Latin America on Saturday, March 8, to protest against machismo violence and the far-right wave led by Argentine President Javier Milei. In Buenos Aires, one of the largest marches marched towards the Plaza de Mayo, 'against fascism, racism, patriarchy, and capitalism.' The organization Ni Una Menos called for 'confronting the far-right that governs with hunger, by force, and cruelty.' 'Milei's scam has echoes around the world and receives applause from billionaires,' the collective wrote on social media, referencing the cultural war waged by Donald Trump and Elon Musk in the US and European far-right. Chilean women also joined the call against the ultra-conservative agenda. Thousands of people in Santiago demanded a more profound struggle for gender equality and the debate on free abortion, still a taboo for most of the country's politicians. 'Women and disidents continue to be the most convocable social movement in Chile,' said Javiera Mena, spokesperson for the Coordinadora Feminista 8M and the Articulaci\u00f3n por la Huelga General Feminista 2025. 'We march today pointing out a government that has prioritized impunity and a repressive agenda over legal abortion, decent pensions, and the right to housing,' she added. In Peru, the feminist movement focused on demands to the government of Dina Boluarte, which it calls an 'authoritarian coalition,' and the Congress, one of the most discredited institutions in the country, which was involved in a prostitution scandal. In Mexico, one of the countries with the most gender violence, the first woman to govern, Claudia Sheinbaum, has been in office for five months. The march on Saturday was the first major one with Sheinbaum in the presidency. Colombian women also marched in major cities under the slogan 'For work and a dignified life, advanced feminism, and collective resistance!' and their president, Gustavo Petro, who has received criticism, even from Vice President Francia M\u00e1rquez, for macho decisions and behavior in the government, has launched a message of support for Sheinbaum on social media. 'I believe that Claudia's election, truly, to the presidency of Mexico, is the chance for true independence of Latin America and the Caribbean. It's time, truly, for the unity of Latin America as the great beacon of human freedom,' he wrote on X.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 12:16 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/america/2025-03-08/una-marea-feminista-se-moviliza-contra-el-patriarcado-y-el-avance-de-la-ultraderecha-en-america-latina.html)\n\n**Football Fans Unite to Support Elderly Protesters**\nFans from over 30 football teams have announced their support for the elderly protesters, who have been violently repressed by the police every week. The fans plan to join the elderly in their march next Wednesday to protect them from the police. The decision comes after a 75-year-old Chacarita fan was injured and fractured his arm during a recent protest. The fans from various teams, including Boca, River, Independiente, and San Lorenzo, have announced their participation on social media, using hashtags and slogans such as 'Hay que ser muy cag\u00f3n para no defender a los jubilados' ('You have to be very foolish not to defend the elderly'). The police have been using force to suppress the protests, and the fans are concerned that the elderly may be harmed. The situation is uncertain, and it is unclear how the police will react. Sergio Romero, a leader of the Uni\u00f3n Obrera, has been criticized for his provocative language, which has included threats of violence and bloodshed. The situation is being closely watched, and it is unclear what will happen next. A recent poll by Atlas Intel found that President Javier Milei's image has fallen by 10 points in a month, with 45% of respondents viewing him positively and 50% viewing him negatively. The poll also found that the government's approval rating is almost evenly split, with 52% of respondents saying they do not trust the government.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[elesquiu.com](https://www.elesquiu.com/editorial/2025/3/9/reaccion-inedita-546290.html)\n\n**Sheinbaum's Historic Approval and Tariff Pause Mark Significant Week in Mexico**\nM\u00e9xico has concluded a significant week with several notable events: a historic approval for President Claudia Sheinbaum, another pause in US tariffs, and the appointment of a new Secretary of Finance. According to a recent survey, Sheinbaum, the first woman to hold the presidency in this nation, obtained an 85% approval rating from citizens in February, the highest index reported in the last 30 years. The survey by El Financiero newspaper found that only 15% of respondents disagreed with Sheinbaum's work, while former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (2018-2024) had achieved an 83% approval rating in the second month of 2019. Sheinbaum's attributes, such as her honesty (83%), leadership (82%), and ability to deliver results (78%), were highlighted by the respondents, who also positively valued her handling of US policies. Additionally, President Sheinbaum confirmed another pause in the 25% tariffs imposed by the US government on Mexican products. After a call with President Donald Trump, the US President suspended the application of tariffs on Mexican goods until April 2, citing a mutually beneficial agreement. Sheinbaum stated, 'M\u00e9xico was treated with much respect and we reached this agreement that really benefits both nations,' adding that cooperation and collaboration in the area of security were recognized. Sheinbaum presented Trump with the results of this month, particularly regarding the decrease in fentanyl crossing from Mexico to the US, based on US statistics. According to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), there was a 41.55% reduction in fentanyl seizures on the US side of the border between January (450 kg seized) and February (263 kg).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/03/08/apoyo-a-sheinbaum-y-pausa-en-aranceles-marcan-semana-en-mexico/)\n\n**The 4 World Leaders with Higher Approval Ratings than Donald Trump**\nA recent survey by Morning Consult found that Donald Trump's approval rating is 52%, surpassing most world leaders. However, there are four leaders who have higher approval ratings: Karin Keller-Sutter, President of Switzerland, Javier Milei, President of Argentina, Claudia Sheinbaum, President of Mexico, and Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India. Modi has the highest approval rating at 75%, followed by Sheinbaum with 66%, Milei with 65%, and Keller-Sutter with 56%.

In contrast, 6% of respondents in India and 7% in Mexico expressed no opinion about their leaders. Modi's disapproval rating is 19%, while Sheinbaum's is 26%. Other leaders with high approval ratings include Javier Milei of Argentina, with 65%, and Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland, with 56%. However, some leaders face significant disapproval, such as Donald Trump in the US, with 38% disapproval, and Giorgia Meloni in Italy, with a higher disapproval rate than approval. Other leaders with high disapproval rates include Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, and Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 01:50 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/modi-sheinbaum-son-lideres-mundiales-mayor-aprobacion-20250210-745660.html)\n\n**Javier Milei Ranks Third in International Survey of Most Popular Leaders**\nAccording to a recent international survey by Morning Consult, Argentine President Javier Milei has ranked as the third most popular leader in the world, with a 65% approval rating. He is only behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who leads with a 75% approval rating, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has a 66% approval rating. The survey, which analyzed the popularity of leaders in 24 countries, found that Milei is above figures such as US President Donald Trump, who has a 52% approval rating and ranks fifth. This position solidifies Milei's image on the global stage and reinforces the positive perception of his management locally. Morning Consult's methodology, based on a seven-day moving average, provides a more stable panorama and minimizes momentary fluctuations. As Morning Consult's survey shows, Milei has consistently appeared in the top rankings, having surpassed Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in November 2024 in terms of popularity. In contrast, the report also reveals the leaders with the highest levels of disapproval, with French President Emmanuel Macron leading the list with a 75% disapproval rating, affected by his decision to advance elections in 2024. Other notable cases include Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who faces a significant decline in support due to the economic crisis and failure to fulfill fiscal promises, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing a critical situation after his suspension and detention on charges of insurrection and abuse of power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 11:53 PM\nSource:[El Intransigente](https://elintransigente.com/2025/02/javier-milei-entre-los-lideres-con-mayor-aprobacion-segun-una-encuesta-internacional/)\n\n**World Leaders' Approval Ratings in 2025: A Dynamic Situation**\nOne month after the 2025 elections, the situation of world leaders regarding public approval has remained dynamic. According to data collected by Morning Consult between January 21 and 27, 2025, approval and disapproval rates vary significantly from country to country. Narendra Modi of India leads the list with 75% approval, followed by Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico with 66%. However, 6% of respondents in India and 7% in Mexico expressed no clear opinion about their respective leaders. Modi's disapproval rate is 19%, while Sheinbaum faces 26% disapproval. In Argentina, Javier Milei has 65% approval, but 30% of respondents disapprove. In Europe, Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland has 56% support, with 24% of people without an opinion and 20% disapproving. In the US, Donald Trump remains a polarizing figure with 52% approval, 10% of respondents without an opinion, and 38% disapproving. In Australia, Anthony Albanese has 46% approval, but 42% of citizens disapprove. In the Netherlands, Dick Schoof maintains moderate approval, with disapproval close behind. Similar situations are seen in Poland, where Donald Tusk faces higher disapproval than approval. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni faces a complicated situation with higher disapproval than approval. In Sweden, Ulf Kristersson is in a similar situation, with high levels of disapproval, while in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa also experiences majority disapproval. Other leaders, such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, also face significant disapproval. In Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez is marked by high disapproval rates, despite having considerable support. In Scandinavian countries like Norway and the UK, disapproval rates remain notably high, reflecting widespread discontent.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/conozca-cuales-son-los-indicadores-de-aprobacion-de-24-lideres-mundiales-en-2025-4058077)\n\n**Global Leaders' Approval Ratings: A Dynamic and Complex Landscape**\nA month after the 2025 elections, the approval ratings of world leaders have remained dynamic.

He is the third leader with the highest approval rating in the world, with 65% of support, behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (75%) and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (66%). Milei's popularity is due to his commitment to reducing the size of the state and promoting a free market, which has generated strong support among sectors seeking an alternative to decades of state intervention. His policies have also led to a decrease in inflation, with projections indicating that it will continue to fall. Additionally, labor conflict has reached its lowest level in 20 years in the second half of 2024, attributed to the implementation of labor flexibility policies and the reduction of regulations imposed by the national government. According to a recent survey by DC Consultores, 8 out of 10 Argentines believe that the opposition uses protests for their own benefit, weakening the impact of these protests. Milei's image has reached a record high of 59% in January 2025, reflecting a sustained growth since September last year. His government also receives the same level of approval, indicating strong popular support for his policies. In the electoral scenario, a study by Isasi/Burdman shows that La Libertad Avanza leads the intention to vote with 36% of support, far ahead of the Peronism (12%), PRO (10%), and Kirchnerism (9%). This suggests that, if legislative elections were held today, the ruling party would consolidate its power in Congress. Donald Trump, one of Milei's main allies, also appears in the top 5 of leaders with the highest approval rating, with a recovered popularity in recent years after a decline following his departure from the White House in 2021. His strong discourse on economic recovery and his fight against the establishment have been key to his resurgence in the polls. His influence in the Republican Party and his return to the presidency of the US have revitalized his image and consolidated his leadership among conservative sectors. This reinforces the hypothesis that we are witnessing a change of era, where figures of the new right, who promote a healthy trade and conservative values, are gaining prominence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[mdzol.com](https://www.mdzol.com/mundo/2025/2/8/la-nueva-derecha-gana-terreno-javier-milei-donald-trump-entre-los-mas-populares-del-mundo-1186732.html)\n\n**Javier Milei's Popularity Surges: A New Era for the New Right?**\nArgentine President Javier Milei has reached a new level of global approval, ranking as the third most popular leader in the world, according to a global survey by Morning Consult. With a 65% approval rating, Milei trails behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (75%) and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (66%). The survey, which polled over 40 countries, found that leaders with centrist-progressive views, such as French President Emmanuel Macron (75% disapproval) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have seen a significant decline in popularity. Milei's popularity is attributed to his perceived fulfillment of campaign promises, including economic reforms and a reduction in government intervention. His policies have also led to a decrease in inflation and conflictivity laboral, with a recent survey showing that 8 out of 10 Argentines believe the opposition is using protests for personal gain. Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, leads the intention of vote with 36% support, followed by the peronismo (12%), PRO (10%), and kirchnerismo (9%). Donald Trump, a key ally of Milei, also ranks in the top 5 of leaders with the highest approval rating, with a 59% positive image, according to a recent survey by Julio Aurelio Aresco. Trump's popularity has recovered in recent years, driven by his economic recovery and anti-establishment discourse. The survey suggests that the new right, which promotes a healthy trade and conservative values, is gaining prominence globally.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/mundo/2025/2/8/la-nueva-derecha-gana-terreno-javier-milei-donald-trump-entre-los-mas-populares-del-mundo-1186732.html)\n\n**Donald Trump's approval rating is better than most world leaders**\nA recent poll conducted by Morning Consult shows that Donald Trump's approval rating is higher than most world leaders, with 52% of respondents approving of him and 38% disapproving. Only four world leaders, including Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, Argentine President Javier Milei, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have higher approval ratings. Trump's popularity is also reflected in a separate poll by Emerson College, which showed that 49% of registered voters approve of him, while 41% disapprove. Experts have attributed Trump's rising popularity to his 'honeymoon period' as president and his ability to tap into populist sentiment. However, his approval ratings are still lower than those of many other presidents, and it remains to be seen whether his popularity will hold.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-world-leaders-2027934)\n\n**Global Survey Reveals Leaders with Highest and Lowest Approval Ratings**\nAccording to a global survey by Visual Capitalist, the current leaders with the highest approval ratings are Narendra Modi of India (75% approval) and Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico (66% approval). Modi was re-elected for a third term as Prime Minister of India in May, while Sheinbaum became the first female President of Mexico in October. Cristian Rojas, head of the Department of Political Science at the U. of the Sabana, said, 'Modi is a very powerful man, he threatens the balance of power, since India had not had a president like him in a long time.' Rojas also noted that Sheinbaum's new presidency and her handling of Trump's tariffs have contributed to her high approval rating. The survey also found that Javier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is the third most popular leader in the world with a 64% approval rating. Rojas said, 'He is a very popular president due to his provocative statements. He has called attention to himself as a libertarian president who will recover Argentina's economy.' The survey also ranked Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland and Donald Trump of the United States, who has a 52% approval rating. On the other hand, the leaders with the lowest approval ratings are Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, who is currently detained on charges of insurrection and abuse of power, and Emmanuel Macron of France, with three-quarters of the population disapproving of his leadership.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 05:12 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/presidentes-de-india-mexico-y-argentina-los-de-mayor-aprobacion-en-el-mundo-4057751)\n\n**Javier Milei Surpasses Donald Trump in International Survey, Ranks Third**\nAccording to an international survey, Javier Milei is the third world leader with the most support, surpassing Donald Trump. The survey, conducted by Morning Consult from January 21 to 27, collected opinions from citizens of 24 countries. The survey showed a diverse panorama of the popularity of world leaders in 2025. Milei, the leader of La Libertad Avanza, received 65% of support and 30% of rejection. The leader with the highest rating in the survey was Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, with a 75% approval rate and 19% disapproval. Claudia Sheinbaum, the President of Mexico, came in second with 66% approval and 26% disapproval. Karin Keller-Sutter, the President of Switzerland, completed the top 5 with 56% approval and 20% disapproval. Interestingly, four of the top 5 leaders have been in office for less than two years, with Modi being the only 'veteran' with 11 years as Prime Minister of India. Donald Trump ranked 8th, while Georgia Meloni of Italy ranked 7th with a negative image, with 50% of respondents disapproving of her.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 01:14 AM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/milei-se-metio-en-el-podio-entre-los-lideres-del-mundo-y-dejo-atras-a-trump-que-puesto-ocupo/)\n\n**Javier Milei Ranks Third in Global Approval Ratings, According to Morning Consult Survey**\nAccording to an international survey by Morning Consult, Argentine President Javier Milei is the third most popular leader in the world, with a 65% approval rating. He is surpassed only by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (75%) and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (66%). The survey, which polled over 40 countries, found that Milei's popularity is due to his consistent performance, with a 65% approval rating. In contrast, some leaders are facing a crisis of image, such as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended and detained for charges of insurrection and abuse of power, with a 25% approval rating. French President Emmanuel Macron also faces a 75% disapproval rating due to his decision to hold early elections in 2024. Morning Consult's survey reflects the perception of citizens in 24 countries, providing an updated panorama of the approval of the world's main leaders in 2025.

The study, which measured the approval ratings of all Latin American presidents, found that the president of Argentina, Javier Milei, had a 46% positive image, but did not rank among the top presidents in the region. The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, had the highest approval rating, with 70%, followed by the president of Uruguay, Luis Lacalle Pou, and the president of Brazil, Luis Ignacio Lula Da Silva, with 48% and 45% respectively. The study also found that the average approval rating of presidents who left office in 2024 was not extremely low, and that the year saw the highest projections of economic improvement among those surveyed. Additionally, the study found that the level of confidence in institutions decreased in areas outside of the presidency, such as the legislative and judicial branches. As stated by the study, 'the 2024 was the year with the highest projections of economic improvement for the people surveyed.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:22 AM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/politica/2025/1/28/ranking-de-presidentes-javier-milei-no-logra-subir-al-podio-en-la-region-1184137.html)\n\n**President Claudia Sheinbaum's First 100 Days: A Combination of Tangible Results and Personal Attributes**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has consolidated a positive image in her first 100 days in office, with an approval rating of 77-78% according to recent polls. This is higher than the initial approval rating of her predecessor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2018. The president's leadership has been praised for its tangible results, including a 18.3% decrease in homicides between 2018 and 2024, and a 16.3% reduction in 2024. Additionally, the president's personal attributes, such as her preparation, strong leadership, and ability to understand the concerns of the people, have contributed to her popularity. However, persistent problems such as the increase in extortion and violence in critical regions require a more in-depth and sustained approach. As Morning Consult's ranking of 25 governors in December 2024 showed, Sheinbaum ranked third with a 65% approval rating, behind Narendra Modi and Javier Milei.
