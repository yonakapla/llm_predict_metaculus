Upon considering new information, experts revised their predictions, with probabilities mostly decreasing or remaining stable. The revised probabilities range from 30% to 75%, with key factors being Netflix's strong nomination count and recognition at other awards, countered by strong competition and lack of specific mentions of the Netflix contenders in question. Overall, the consensus leans towards a moderate likelihood, with an average probability around 50%.",
