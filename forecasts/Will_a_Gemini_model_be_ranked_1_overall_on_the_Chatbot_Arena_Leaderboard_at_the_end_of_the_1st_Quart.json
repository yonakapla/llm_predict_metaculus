The new model is available in four variants: 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B parameters. The main improvement is the increase in the context window to 128,000 tokens, compared to 80,000 tokens in Gemma 2, allowing for more complex scenarios and larger requests. Gemma 3 supports multimodal analysis of text, images, and short videos, automation of tasks through function calls, and works with 140 languages. Google has also introduced quantum versions of the model, which reduce computational costs by 'compressing' numerical values in neural network weights without losing accuracy. This allows Gemma 3 to run on a single GPU or TPU, critical for local applications. According to the company, Gemma 3 demonstrates 'leading performance for its class,' outperforming LLMs such as Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3, and o3-mini. In Chatbot Arena Elo tests, the 27B version ranked second after DeepSeek-R1, surpassing Mistral Large and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Developers can integrate Gemma 3 through tools like Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama, PyTorch, JAX, and Keras, as well as Google AI Studio, Hugging Face, or Kaggle. For corporate clients, access to the model API is available through AI Studio. Safety has become a key focus of the update, with Gemma 3 featuring a 4B-parameter image filter, ShieldGemma 2, which blocks the generation of content with violence, sexual scenes, and other violations. The system allows for customization according to user needs. As Google notes, the model was trained with strict data processing rules, fine-tuning according to security policies, and risk tests, including evaluation of potential misuse in creating hazardous substances. The interest in small models has grown significantly since the debut of the first Gemma in February 2024. Models like Microsoft Phi-4 and Mistral Small 3 confirm the demand for AI capable of solving narrow tasks without excessive LLM power. Gemma is not a distilled version of Gemini, but rather a model trained on the same dataset and architecture without direct 'inheritance' of knowledge from the large model. Companies are increasingly choosing SLM or distilled versions of LLM for specific scenarios. For example, instead of deploying a powerful model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet for a simple code editor, it is more efficient to use a compact alternative that does not require significant resources and reduces the risk of overfitting. With the release of Gemma 3, Google strengthens its position in this segment, offering a balance between performance, cost, and security.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 05:27 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2025/03/12/google-gemma-3-128k.html)\n\n**Google Gemini collects far more personal data than its rivals, surprising nobody**\nGoogle Gemini collects significantly more user data than other mainstream AI chatbots, including 22 types of data out of 35 tested, according to research by Surfshark VPN.
