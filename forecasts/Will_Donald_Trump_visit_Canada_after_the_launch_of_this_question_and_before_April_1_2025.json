This decision comes after he announced that he would pause tariffs on Mexico. According to Trump, the pause in tariffs on Canada will also apply to products under the T-MEC agreement. However, Trump did not confirm whether he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom he mocked earlier. Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutinick, had previously hinted at the possibility of a similar decision being made for Canada. Trudeau has not commented on the new pause in tariffs, but had previously stated that he expects a trade war with the US in the near future. Trudeau emphasized that Canada will not remove tariffs until Trump completely removes them, not just pauses them. He also urged Canadians to consume local products and remain strong in the face of 'unjustified' US tariffs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[SDPnoticias.com](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/internacional/no-solo-mexico-donald-trump-pauso-aranceles-de-estados-unidos-a-canada)\n\n**After Mexico, Trump delays Canadian goods from tariffs**\nUS President Donald Trump has suspended the 25 per cent tariffs he imposed on most goods from Canada and Mexico, citing progress in addressing fentanyl imports. The exemptions, which expire on April 2, exclude some energy products but not all, and do not cover steel and aluminum imports. Canada will delay its retaliatory tariffs on US products until April 2. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, 'On April 2, we're going to move with the reciprocal tariffs, and hopefully Mexico and Canada will have done a good enough job on fentanyl that this part of the conversation will be off the table, and we'll move just to the reciprocal tariff conversation.' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he does not expect the trade war to abate any time soon. 'I can confirm that we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future,' he said. Mexican officials have expressed frustration with the lack of clarity over US desires in tariff negotiations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/after-mexico-donald-trump-delays-canadian-goods-from-tariffs-2690080-2025-03-07)\n\n**Donald Trump gives Canada another reprieve on threatened tariffs until April 2**\nUS President Donald Trump has given Canada and Mexico a temporary reprieve from tariffs until April 2, when he threatens to impose tariffs on all global imports. Trump signed new executive orders that delay tariffs on products sold into the US that comply with the renegotiated North America free trade deal's rules on country of origin and content. However, 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will still go ahead next week. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said, 'We can't only have a 30-day pause.' Joly added that the 'big end game' for Canada is the April 2 deadline when Trump has promised to punish countries for what he views as 'unfair' trade practices. Trump shrugged off the move, saying it was not about the stock market reaction, but about addressing 'globalist companies that have been ripping us off.' A White House fact sheet issued after Trump spoke said tariffs would not apply to the auto sector for now, and energy and potash products that fall outside the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement would face only 10% tariffs. B.C. Premier David Eby said Canadians are 'pissed off' at Trump's unpredictable ways, but that the US president 'has realized what we told him from the beginning, which is that these tariffs hurt Americans.' Trudeau called early reports of further exemptions or carve-outs from US tariffs a 'promising sign,' but warned that 'we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 10:44 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/donald-trump-gives-canada-another-reprieve-on-threatened-tariffs-until-april-2/article_8c6c52ba-fab3-11ef-a03e-1bebe742f50d.html)\n\n**Donald Trump Suspends Tariffs on Canada and Mexico Until April 2**\nUS President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will suspend for a month, until April 2, the application of the 25% tariffs on Canada for products covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a measure he had already adopted with Mexico earlier in the day, after speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Trump signed an executive order that delays the imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, until April 2. The only products that will be exempt from the 25% tariffs of the United States will be those covered by the USMCA, which Trump renegotiated during his first term (2017-2021) to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). A period of uncertainty has opened up for companies that trade between the three countries, as they will only be able to benefit from this tariff exemption for a month. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, his main trading partners, on Tuesday (March 4), but the White House announced a one-month pause in the application of those tariffs for the automotive sector of both countries, after conversations with the main US manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Stellantis - that assemble vehicles in Mexico and Canada. This moratorium for vehicles and their components will be in effect until April 2. Trump's arrival at the White House has caused a 180-degree turn in relations with Canada, which until now had been the country with which the US had the best relations. In recent hours, Trump has launched serious accusations against Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The US President accuses Trudeau of being the cause of the tariff war and argues that he is using it to his advantage to run again in the next elections. Last January, Trudeau announced that he would resign from his position.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[Antena3](https://www.antena3.com/noticias/mundo/donald-trump-paraliza-aranceles-canada-mexico-2-abril_2025030667ca0d3ebd6bf00001f96224.html)\n\n**Trump says he is pausing tariffs on  some Canadian goods until April 2 | RCI**\nU.S. President Donald Trump has announced that he is pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, offering the country a roughly month-long reprieve from a 25% levy. However, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that there's no sign that Trump is willing to drop his levies entirely and that a trade dispute will continue for the foreseeable future. Trudeau said that negotiations are ongoing to secure some form of tariff relief for certain sectors, but that talks have not been finalized. Trudeau acknowledged that the 50-minute conversation between the two men was heated, but said it was a substantive call and that there could be a resolution to these issues, at least in the short term. Trudeau stressed that the U.S. government's own border seizure data shows Canada is not much of a problem and that the country is doing all it can to tamp down on the drug fentanyl. 'We will continue to be in a trade war that was launched for the U.S. for the foreseeable future,' Trudeau said. 'Our goal is to get all tariffs removed,' he added. Canadian officials remain defiant over U.S. tariffs and will hold firm and push ahead with retaliatory tariffs and other measures until Trump backs off entirely.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 08:35 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2146147/trump-says-he-is-pausing-tariffs-on-some-canadian-goods-until-april-2)\n\n**Canadian Goods Exempt from US Tariffs**\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a decree extending the exemption of tariffs on Canadian goods until April 2, 2025. The exemption, initially granted to the automotive sector on March 5, 2025, now applies to other Canadian products subject to the rules set by the Canada-US-Mexico Free Trade Agreement (ACEUM). Trump has also reduced the tariffs on potash, used as fertilizer in agriculture, from 25% to 10%. However, the 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, including from Canada, will remain unchanged, according to Trump. The new tariffs are set to take effect on March 12.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 08:35 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/videos/1-10316715/produits-canadiens-exemptes-tarifs-douaniers-americains)\n\n**Justin Trudeau roasted for threat against tiny American coastal town**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested that Canadians will boycott a coastal town in Maine, Old Orchard Beach, in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Trudeau called the tariffs 'very dumb' and said Canadians will choose to buy Canadian products and avoid American ones. However, his comments were met with ridicule, with many questioning why Canadians would choose to visit Old Orchard Beach. Data from the Maine Office of Tourism shows that over half a million Canadians visited Maine in 2024, with two out of three visitors staying in the state for the duration of their trip. Trudeau also launched a blistering response to Trump's tariffs, calling it a 'very dumb thing to do' and criticizing the US for launching a trade war against Canada while trying to work positively with Russia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 09:40 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14465983/justin-trudeau-threat-old-orchard-beach-tariffs.html)\n\n**A plea to the King from Canada: reconsider a second Trump state visit**\nSeveral readers have expressed concerns about a potential second state visit from Donald Trump, citing his hostile views towards the UK's core values and interests. Kenneth Preston argues that the offer of a state visit has made the country a 'hostage to fortune', while John Kennedy suggests that Trump's denigration of the British Armed Forces should be a reason to withdraw the invitation. Others propose delaying the visit due to a full Royal diary or considering the potential popularity of a Democratic presidential candidate in 2028. Edward Page notes that the mood in the US is one of insularity, with many Americans having little respect for European countries. 'We should be aware that the president would be more popular among American voters if he did not help us,' he writes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2025/03/05/letters-canada-begs-king-to-reconsider-second-trump-visit/)\n\n**Top news of the day: March 5, 2025**\nCanada has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States over President Donald Trump's tariff increases. Canadian ambassador to the WTO Nadia Theodore wrote that 'the U.S. decision leaves us with no choice'. The WTO confirmed that Canada initiated dispute proceedings against the U.S. on the additional tariffs. In other news, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.

However, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick announced that an agreement with Mexico and Canada could be reached as early as Wednesday. 'I think [Trump] will reach an agreement with them. It won't be a pause, nothing like that, but I think he will resolve: 'You do more and we'll meet in the middle somehow', and probably we'll announce it tomorrow,' Lutnick said in an interview with Fox Business. Lutnick emphasized that 'both Mexicans and Canadians were talking to me all day on the phone, trying to show that they will do better, and the President is listening, because he is very, very fair and very reasonable.' Trump defended the imposition of tariffs on Mexico and Canada in his first address to Congress, stating that 'for decades, countries have taken advantage of the US. We're not going to let it happen anymore.' He also mentioned the need for Mexico and Canada to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, which has resulted in unprecedented numbers of US deaths. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on any products not made in the US, and announced that the US would impose reciprocal tariffs on Mexico and Canada, starting on April 2.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/guerra-comercial-2/)\n\n**Trump's Tariff War: US to Impose Tariffs on Various Countries Starting March 4, 2025**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced that the US will impose tariffs on various countries starting from March 4, 2025. This move could further escalate trade tensions, as Trump has decided to personally decide on the tariff rates based on information provided by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump has warned on social media that 'something big' will happen on March 2, 2025, indicating that he is fully prepared to implement his trade strategies. The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bentsen, has stated that Mexico has agreed to impose similar tariffs on China, which could be a positive step for the US. However, the Trump administration is also expecting Canada to take a similar step, which could lead to a new direction in the trade war. The US has recently launched a new investigation into imported wood, which could lead to additional tariffs and further escalate trade tensions not only with Canada and Mexico but also with other countries. Commerce Secretary Lutnick has hinted that the US may increase tariffs on Chinese goods, especially if China fails to control the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also stated that he has no intention of delaying the tariff plan, and the deadline has been set for March 4, 2025, before the previously set deadline of April 2. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has arrived in the US amidst this growing trade tension, and his visit is seen as an attempt to mitigate the impact of the US trade strategies on India. The US tariff war could have a significant impact on global trade, and it may lead to further trade tensions with countries like China, India, and others.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 12:16 AM\nSource:[punjabkesari](https://m.punjabkesari.in/international/news/trump-s-big-announcement-tariff-war-will-start-from-today-2114505)\n\n**That's enough: Trump shoots down question on Canada during press conference**\nUS President Donald Trump interrupted UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a joint press conference, saying 'That's enough, thank you' after Starmer replied to a question about Canada. Trump had previously decided to continue imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, citing the flow of illicit drugs allegedly coming into the US from their borders. Trump said, 'Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.' He also vowed to stop or 'seriously limit' such drugs, especially Fentanyl, which he said has caused over 100,000 deaths in the US last year. Trump added that China will also be charged an additional 10 per cent tariff from March 4, and the April 2 reciprocal tariff date will remain in full force and effect.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 02:18 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/that-s-enough-trump-shoots-down-question-on-canada-during-press-conference-125022800090_1.html)\n\n**Trump Provokes Canada Ahead of Ice Hockey Match**\nUS President Donald Trump has continued to provoke Canada ahead of the highly anticipated ice hockey match between the two national teams. Trump wrote on his 'Truth Social' platform, 'I will call our great American ice hockey team today to encourage them to win tonight against Canada, which will one day, maybe soon, become our valued and very important 51st state with lower taxes and stronger security.' Trump indeed called the US team before the game, as confirmed by the White House. Trump will not be able to attend the game in Boston due to a scheduling conflict in Washington D.C. and will watch it on TV. The provocations are not new, as Trump has repeatedly expressed plans to impose tariffs on Canadian goods and has repeatedly stated his desire to annex Canada as the 51st US state. Trump has also referred to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as 'Governor Trudeau', a title given to the political leaders of US states. The US team's performance was marked by controversy, including boos during the national anthem and three fights in the first nine seconds of playtime. The US team won the game 3-1, their first victory over Canada in 15 years. The dominant theme, however, was the boos. 'I didn't like it, that's all,' said Matthew Tkachuk. Tkachuk, a star player who recently visited Trump at the White House, was not alone in his sentiments. 'We have a room full of proud American players, coaches, and staff,' said Guerin. 'We're just trying to represent our country as well as possible.' Meanwhile, Canadian star Sidney Crosby is seeking revenge. 'I'm trying to learn from the last game and know what's coming,' said Crosby. It remains unclear if Crosby was referring to the potential boos against the Canadian national anthem, but it is certain that they will occur. The question is how loud they will be.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 10:30 PM\nSource:[n-tv.de](https://www.n-tv.de/sport/Trump-provoziert-Kanada-vor-Eishockey-Kracher-article25578241.html)\n\n**Canada Launches 'Seduction Offensive' in Washington to Avoid Trump's Tariffs**\nThe 13 provincial premiers of Canada have traveled to Washington, D.C. to conduct an intense diplomatic campaign to persuade President Donald Trump and key Republican lawmakers not to impose high tariffs on Canadian products, including steel and aluminum. This move reflects the growing concern in Canada about Trump's unpredictable trade strategy, who has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 50% on Canadian exports if all announced rounds of tariffs are implemented simultaneously. Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario and President of the Federation Council, stated, 'It hasn't happened yet,' highlighting the uncertainty generated by Trump's daily fluctuations in decisions. The Canadian leaders insist that diplomacy remains the best tool to face the tariff threats. According to Ford, 'The President knows we're here, knows we're concerned, and we're working together... We just want to move forward. We'd like there to be no tariffs, that's what we want.' The Canadian premiers have adopted a conciliatory approach during their visit, with Wab Kinew, Premier of Manitoba, describing the mission as a 'seduction offensive' aimed at strengthening friendship between the two countries. Danielle Smith, Premier of Alberta, stated that she believes Trump's initial tariff threats were related to border security and fentanyl trafficking, and that diplomacy is working. Smith also emphasized the importance of preparing for future trade negotiations, suggesting that Canada needs federal elections soon to obtain a clear mandate to return to the negotiating table.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 07:46 PM\nSource:[hispanicpost.com](https://hispanicpost.com/2025/02/12/canada-lanza-una-ofensiva-de-seduccion-en-washington-para-evitar-aranceles-de-trump/)\n\n**Trump Launches Commercial War Against Canada**\nUS President Donald Trump has launched a commercial war against Canada by imposing a 25% punitive tariff on almost all Canadian products, a unprecedented blow to a long-standing ally that could have devastating effects on the country's economy. The threat of Trump's long-standing plan to inflict economic damage on Canada has materialized, as he said he would. The US economic attack includes a 10% tariff on Canadian energy products, according to a high-ranking Canadian official who shared details of Trump's plan with the Canadian public broadcaster CBC. These potentially devastating tariffs will take effect on February 4 and will remain in place until Trump is satisfied that Canada is taking the necessary steps to stop the flow of fentanyl to the US, the official said. Experts noted that a commercial measure of this magnitude has the potential to subtract billions of dollars from Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and plunge the country into a painful recession that will require government stimulus to prop up the economy. Canada is expected to respond later on Saturday with its own retaliatory tariffs to make Trump think twice before attacking the country economically. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to make an announcement at 6 p.m. on Saturday, according to sources at CBC. Trump's decision on Saturday shows that no country is safe from his attempt to drastically reform the US economy, roll back globalization, and dismantle free trade agreements like the new CUSMA, or T-MEC, the Canada-US-Mexico agreement signed in his first term. According to Canadian government data, only in the first nine months of 2024, goods worth $800 billion crossed the border between Canada and the US. Trump's tariffs could reduce the flow of those goods, with significant implications for businesses and workers on both sides of the border, given the high level of economic integration between the two countries after decades of liberalized trade.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 10:39 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/es/noticia/2137148/trump-lanza-una-guerra-comercial-contra-canada-imponiendo-un-arancel-del-25)\n\n**Guatemalan President to Begin Two-Day Visit to Canada**\nGuatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei will begin a two-day visit to Canada on January 27, 2025. According to Foreign Minister Carlos Ramiro Mart\u00ednez, the President will meet with business leaders, the Guatemalan migrant community, and receive a donation from Canadian firefighters. The President will also receive a recognition from the Canadian Council for the Americas for his work as a 'statesman and more than anything as a democrat', as Mart\u00ednez emphasized. This visit comes seven days after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, which Guatemalan Ambassador to Washington DC Hugo Beteta attended. The President's trip is his first international visit in 2025, following a previous agenda in New York in September 2024 focused on the 79th session of the UN General Assembly. The President's administration, which is set to conclude in 2028, aims to reduce corruption, achieve transparency in public management, and promote economic growth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/01/27/presidente-de-guatemala-comenzara-visita-de-dos-dias-a-canada/)\n\n**Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n Embarks on First Trip of the Year to Canada**\nGuatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n departed for Canada on Sunday for a two-day visit to the country, where he will be honored by the Canadian Council for the Americas. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n will have three official events during his stay in Canada, all scheduled for Monday. The President's office confirmed that Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n is already en route to Canada. During his visit, Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n will meet with Canadian business leaders and receive a donation from local firefighters for their colleagues in Guatemala. He will also be awarded the 2024 Statesman of the Year award by the Canadian Council for the Americas. This is Ar\u00e9valo de Le\u00f3n's first trip of the year, marking one year since he took office on January 14, 2024. The brief trip to Canada comes a week after the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President and a week before the planned visit to Guatemala by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/internacional/cancilleria-informa-que-bernardo-arevalo-partio-rumbo-a-canada-para-tres-eventos-oficiales/)\n\n**Donald Trump's Shadow Looms Over CAQ Pre-Session Caucus**\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault will address the media on Monday afternoon, just after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Legault has called a press conference in Pr\u00e9vost, Quebec, where he will make a local announcement and then take questions from journalists before attending the CAQ's pre-session caucus in Saint-Sauveur. The caucus, which will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will likely focus on the threat of Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. According to Legault, Quebec could lose up to 100,000 jobs. Legault has already stated that he plans to visit Washington twice before April. In an open letter published in the American media outlet 'The Hill' last Wednesday, Legault warned that these tariffs could backfire on Americans. He pointed out that Quebec exports aluminum and military aviation supplies to the US, which it cannot produce itself in the short and medium term. As a result, with tariffs, Americans will end up paying more for these products, he said. Later, at a meeting of the Council of the Federation, Legault sided with his Ontario counterpart, Doug Ford, who has not ruled out cutting off energy to the US as a retaliatory measure. After the meeting, 12 provincial and territorial premiers published a statement committing to present a united front to their American counterparts. However, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith refused to sign the statement, explaining on social media that she could not support the 'Team Canada' approach if energy exports could be part of the federal government's response.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 08:16 PM\nSource:[lecourriersud.com](https://www.lecourriersud.com/nouvelles-nationales/lombre-de-donald-trump-plane-sur-le-caucus-presessionnel-de-la-caq/)\n\n**In the news today: Donald Trump set to return to the White House**\nDonald Trump is set to return to the White House with a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, which could lead to retaliatory tariffs from the Canadian government.

Trump stated, 'Many Canadians are happy to let Canada become the 51st state of the US. The US cannot continue to support Canada's massive trade deficit and subsidies.' Trump also mentioned that if Canada joins the US, there will be no tariffs and taxes will be significantly reduced. Additionally, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. is planning to visit Greenland, a move that has sparked controversy. Trump has long expressed his desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark, but the island's government has rejected the idea. Trump's visit to Greenland is seen as a way to promote his father's agenda. Meanwhile, Trump's confirmation as US President has been confirmed by the US Congress, with 312 electoral votes in his favor. Trump's inauguration is set to take place on January 20, 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 12:23 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202501083290415363.html)\n\n**Donald Trump Jr.'s Visit to Greenland: A Step Towards a Broader Imperialist Project**\nDonald Trump Jr. has arrived in Greenland, sparking speculation about the reasons for his visit. The trip comes as President-elect Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to buy or annex the country during his second term. According to sources, the purpose of Don Jr.'s visit is to film content for his podcast, 'Triggered with Don Jr.'. The podcast, launched in January 2023, is the most listened to on Rumble, a platform popular with conservative Americans. Trump has welcomed the trip on Truth Social, while reiterating his ambition to annex Canada. The visit has been met with interest from the Danish press, with several media outlets covering the event live. The trip is part of a broader imperialist project, with Trump and his allies aiming to expand US territory. The project includes the annexation of Canada and the construction of a canal in Panama. A map showing a US expansion to the Mediterranean and the South China Sea has been viewed over 5 million times on X, a social media platform. The map is part of a trend known as 'Ameriwank', where users reimagine the US map with alternative histories. Trump's proposal to annex Greenland is seen as a serious idea by some, with one advisor stating that expansion is a time-honored American tradition. The majority of Canadians oppose the idea of becoming the 51st US state, with only 13% in favor. Trump has stated that the ownership and control of Greenland are necessary for US security and freedom. The visit has been met with skepticism, with some questioning the true motives behind Trump's plans.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[legrandcontinent.eu](https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2025/01/07/donald-trump-jr-au-groenland-le-projet-imperial-trumpiste-dune-grande-amerique-en-deux-cartes-exclusives/)\n\n",

Given today\u2019s date of March 7, 2025, and a window of fewer than a month until April 1, the base rate for such visits by Trump in a similarly narrow time frame outside of significant diplomatic functions is likely low, around 10%.
