Aitor Nogales, an investigator at the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Sanidad Animal (CISA), believes that 'although there is a problem with the stock of eggs for human consumption, this does not mean it will be a problem internationally, and the laboratories will likely have their own farms to supply them. I do not think it will be a problem in case of a pandemic. If anything, the vaccines would be more expensive.' Fernando Moraga-Llop, a pediatrician and spokesperson for the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Vacunolog\u00eda (AEV), suggests that vaccination 'could be indicated in situations of zoonotic epidemic in some farm in some area and, apart from vaccinating animals and people who had contact with those animals, it could be evaluated, which is what is happening in Canada.' The European Commission has signed an agreement to purchase 600,000 doses of vaccine against avian flu with the possibility of expanding to 40 million. Spain has also announced that it will acquire vaccines for avian flu in the next joint purchase process of the EU. There are alternative methods for producing vaccines, such as using cell cultures, which can avoid the use of eggs. 'In case of an urgent need for vaccines, although the flu vaccine is made in eggs in most cases, there are also cell culture lines that have been tested and proven, and that avoid eggs. That is, in case there are no eggs, there are solutions,' says Nogales. Additionally, there are other alternatives to the GSK vaccine, such as Celldemic and Incellipan, which are developed in cell cultures and have been approved in May 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 12:40 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/salud/esta-riesgo-vacuna-frente-h5n1-escasez-huevos_2025032067d33dd36e95850001fadf9a.html)\n\n**Why 2025 may be the year of the measles epidemic**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have warned that the world may be on the brink of a measles epidemic in 2025. The number of measles cases has increased by 43% in 2022 compared to the previous year, with over 10 million cases reported in 2023. The virus is highly contagious, with one infected person able to spread it to up to 18 others. The situation in Europe is particularly concerning, with over 127,000 cases reported in 2024, and 40% of those infected being children under the age of five. Kazakhstan has reported the highest number of cases, with 36,000 reported, while Azerbaijan has the highest rate of infection per capita. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has also reported a measles outbreak in the states of New Mexico and Texas, resulting in two deaths. According to WHO and UNICEF, over 35 million children worldwide have not received the measles vaccine or have not received the necessary number of doses. In Ukraine, the situation is critical, with only 60.6% of children under one year old receiving the first dose of the vaccine, and 56.3% receiving the second dose. The Ministry of Health in Ukraine has received 210,000 doses of vaccine, but the future supply is uncertain. A recent survey showed that only 64.7% of Ukrainians have a positive attitude towards vaccination, with 19.5% being categorical opponents. Experts consider a measles outbreak in Ukraine in 2025 to be highly likely.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/opinion/ukraine-grozit-epidemiya-kori-vrach-predupredila-ob-opasnosti-50499104.html)\n\n**Taiwan's Influenza Epidemic Continues, CDC Extends Eligibility for Public Funding of Antiviral Medications**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that the number of people seeking medical attention for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Taiwan exceeded 100,000 last week, despite a downward trend. The CDC stated that the number of ILI cases in emergency departments decreased by 4% compared to the previous week, but the proportion of ILI cases in emergency departments remained high at 11%, close to the epidemic threshold. According to CDC spokesperson, Tseng Shu-hui, the recent drop in temperature may prolong the influenza epidemic until the end of March. The CDC has extended the eligibility criteria for public funding of antiviral medications to include individuals with ILI symptoms and a family member, colleague, or classmate with ILI. The CDC will continue to evaluate whether to extend the eligibility period, which is currently set to expire on March 31. In addition, the CDC reported 6 new cases of severe COVID-19 and 1 death last week, despite the low number of cases. The CDC announced that it will provide the second dose of the JN.1 vaccine starting on April 8, targeting individuals aged 65 and above, indigenous people aged 55-64, and immunocompromised patients aged 6 months and above. The CDC also reported that the dominant strain of COVID-19 in Taiwan over the past four weeks has been XEC, followed by JN.1 and LP.8.1. The CDC will provide two types of COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna and Novavax, with a total of 3 million doses available. Individuals aged 12 and above who have not received the JN.1 COVID-19 vaccine can choose one of the two types of vaccines for their second dose.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%B5%81%E6%84%9F%E5%8B%BE%E5%8B%BE%E7%BA%8F-%E4%B8%8A%E5%91%A8%E9%96%80%E6%80%A5%E8%A8%BA%E9%80%BE10%E8%90%AC%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%A1-201000035.html)\n\n**Taiwan CDC Announces Second Dose of JN.1 Vaccine for High-Risk Groups**\nThe risk of severe and fatal COVID-19 cases remains high, according to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). To mitigate this risk, the CDC announced that starting April 8, individuals aged 65 and above, indigenous people aged 55-64, and those with compromised immune systems or low immune function will be eligible for a second dose of the JN.1 vaccine. According to CDC spokesperson Lee Chia-lin, 'the domestic COVID-19 epidemic is at a low point, but there are still new severe cases being reported.' Lee noted that from September 1 last year to March 17 this year, there were 522 cases of severe COVID-19 cases, with 112 deaths, mostly among individuals aged 65 and above with chronic illnesses. Lee also pointed out that among the confirmed and fatal cases reported since October 1 last year, 96% or more were unvaccinated. The CDC has detected that the XEC variant is the dominant strain in the past four weeks, followed by JN.1 and LP.8.1. To protect high-risk groups, the CDC will provide the second dose of the JN.1 vaccine to eligible individuals, with a gap of at least six months (180 days) between the first and second doses. According to CDC spokesperson Tseng Shu-hui, 'we estimate that around one million people will be eligible for the second dose, with a vaccination rate of around 20% among the 4.5 million individuals aged 65 and above.' The CDC has reported that a total of 2.044 million people have received the JN.1 vaccine as of March 17, with 1.916 million receiving the Moderna JN.1 vaccine and 127,000 receiving the Novavax JN.1 vaccine.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:59 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202503180220.aspx)\n\n**Taiwan Reports 45 Severe Cases and 15 Deaths from Influenza Last Week**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released the latest influenza epidemic monitoring report, showing that the number of influenza patients visiting emergency departments has decreased, but the epidemic is still at a peak. Last week, 45 severe cases and 15 deaths were reported, with most cases caused by A(H1N1) influenza. The CDC warns that the sudden drop in temperature this week will increase the risk of community transmission. According to the CDC's laboratory monitoring data, A(H1N1) influenza is the most common respiratory pathogen in the community. Since October 1, 2024, a total of 1,152 severe cases have been reported, with 1,075 cases caused by A(H1N1), 54 cases by A(H3N2), and 14 cases by B-type influenza. The majority of patients are over 65 years old, accounting for 58% of the total. The CDC has extended the eligibility period for public-funded influenza antiviral medication to March 31, 2025, for individuals with influenza-like symptoms and a family member, colleague, or classmate with influenza. The CDC urges the public to be aware of the symptoms of influenza, such as fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle pain, and to seek medical attention immediately if they experience severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, bloody sputum, or severe chest pain, etc.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:34 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u982d\u6bbc Newtalk](https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2025-03-18/961074)\n\n**Taiwan Still in Grip of Flu Season, CDC Warns of Increased Risk**\nTaiwan is still in the grip of the flu season, with a recent drop in temperature threatening to worsen the situation. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the flu is at a critical level, and it is currently estimated that it will take until the end of March to exit the flu season. The CDC has expanded the public-funded flu antiviral medication usage period to the end of March and will reassess whether to extend it. Last week, there were approximately 108,000 cases of influenza-like illness, with the majority being A(H1N1) type. There were 45 severe cases and 15 deaths, with the majority being caused by H1N1. Since the start of the flu season on October 1, 2024, there have been 1,152 severe cases, with 1,075 of them being A(H1N1), 54 being A(H3N2), and 9 being untyped A. The majority of the severe cases were among people aged 65 and above, accounting for 58%. The total number of deaths is 254, with 243 being A(H1N1), 8 being A(H3N2), and 3 being B type.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, known as H5N1, has killed millions of wild birds and led to emergency culling of commercial flocks. Nationwide, there have been 70 confirmed human cases since 2024, with most cases among farmworkers who are in daily close contact with poultry and cattle. Experts emphasize the importance of comprehensive case surveillance, testing, and a public health strategy that recognizes the interdependence of humans, animals, and the environment. Dr. Amber Itle, the state veterinarian for Washington state, said, 'When we start to take away resources that we need to support animal health response, that ultimately could threaten public health.' The virus has been detected in more than 200 mostly wild and feral mammals in the US since 2022, and officials are urging people to refrain from drinking raw milk and feeding dogs and cats raw pet food.

Since April 2024, CDC has confirmed 70 human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States, with most (67 of 70) cases having exposure to infected or presumed to be infected dairy cows or poultry. The immediate risk to the general public remains low, but CDC is taking actions to be ready in case the current risk for the public changes. Three recent cases in Nevada, Ohio, and Wyoming involved people who became ill in 2025, with two cases involving poultry workers who experienced severe illness and were hospitalized. CDC has successfully sequenced the viruses from the Nevada and Wyoming cases, and genetic data have been posted in GISAID and GenBank. The analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus isolated from the patient in Nevada identified the virus as an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from clade 2.3.4.4.b (genotype D1.1), with a genetic mutation in its polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein that has previously been associated with more efficient virus replication in mammalian cells. CDC also did not identify any changes that might impact effectiveness of influenza antiviral medications or existing clade 2.3.4.4b H5 candidate vaccine viruses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-02262025.html)\n\n**US Sees Two New Cases of H5N1 Avian Flu, Experts Warn of Potential for More Severe Outbreak**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported two cases of H5N1 avian flu in the US, one in Wyoming and one in Ohio. Both patients showed respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms, but the CDC did not provide further details. The Wyoming patient, a elderly woman, is still hospitalized after contracting the virus from her backyard chickens. The Ohio patient, an adult male, contracted the virus while working at a commercial facility that was culling H5N1-infected birds, and has since been discharged. Since the first human case of avian flu in the US in 2024, there have been approximately 70 confirmed human cases, but experts believe the actual number may be underestimated. The US has not yet seen any cases of person-to-person transmission of avian flu, with most cases occurring in people who have had close contact with animals. Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a US virologist, expressed concern that the H5N1 virus may be more severe than expected, and warned that 'I'm very worried about hospitals that are treating both H5N1 and seasonal flu patients, because it could create opportunities for the viruses to reassort and produce a highly transmissible variant.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 09:15 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E6%B0%91%E7%9C%BE%E6%8E%A5%E8%A7%B8%E6%9F%93%E7%96%AB%E5%AE%B6%E7%A6%BD%E7%A2%BA%E8%A8%BAh5n1-%E5%B0%88%E5%AE%B6%E7%A4%BA%E8%AD%A6-%E6%81%90%E8%88%87%E6%B5%81%E6%84%9F%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E7%B5%90%E5%90%88%E7%94%A2%E7%94%9F%E6%96%B0%E8%AE%8A%E7%A8%AE-080243135.html)\n\n**Taiwan Reports Record Number of Severe and Fatal Influenza Cases**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan reported that the number of severe and fatal cases of influenza has reached a 5-year high in the 7th week of 2025. According to laboratory monitoring data, the dominant respiratory pathogen in the community is the influenza virus, with A(H1N1) being the most common subtype, which is consistent with the vaccine strain for this season. The CDC warned that the risk of transmission remains high due to factors such as temperature changes, the Lantern Festival, and the start of the school year. The CDC emphasized that people should seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cyanosis (hypoxia), thick or bloody sputum, chest pain, altered consciousness, low blood pressure, or prolonged high fever. The CDC also stated that the number of severe cases has increased, with 122 new cases and 21 deaths reported last week, with most cases being A(H1N1) infections. The CDC has purchased 100,000 doses of influenza vaccine and has distributed them to all counties and cities. Starting from February 20, 2,280 contracted medical institutions (including 233 hospitals, 1,749 clinics, and 298 health centers) will provide free influenza vaccination services to the public. However, due to the limited supply of vaccines, the CDC has temporarily suspended the provision of vaccines to the general public, and only 11 categories of people, including those aged 65 and above, indigenous people aged 55 and above, and people with underlying diseases, will be eligible for vaccination. The CDC reminded the public to check the list of contracted medical institutions in their area and make an appointment for vaccination.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 07:17 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%B5%81%E6%84%9F%E9%87%8D%E7%97%87%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%A1%E6%95%B8-5%E5%B9%B4%E5%90%8C%E6%9C%9F%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98-10%E8%90%AC%E5%8A%91%E5%85%AC%E8%B2%BB%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%972-20%E8%B5%B7%E6%8E%A5%E7%A8%AE-065823308.html)\n\n**Taiwan Reports High Influenza Activity, CDC Urges Vaccination**\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that there were approximately 148,000 cases of influenza-related visits to emergency departments in the 7th week of 2025 (February 9-15), a decrease from the previous week but still one of the highest in the past decade. The CDC also stated that the A(H1N1) subtype of influenza virus is currently dominant in the community, and that the purchased 1 million doses of influenza vaccine have been distributed to all counties and cities. The CDC urged people to get vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent severe symptoms. According to the CDC, there were 122 new severe cases and 21 deaths due to influenza in the past week, with the majority being A(H1N1) subtype. The total number of severe cases this season is 917, with 56% of them being elderly people over 65 years old. The CDC also reported that 181 people have died from influenza, with 86% and 90% of them not having received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The CDC reminded people to be aware of the symptoms of influenza, such as difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, bloody sputum or thick sputum, chest pain, altered consciousness, low blood pressure, or high fever lasting more than 72 hours. The CDC also stated that the international situation is severe, with neighboring countries and regions such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea having high levels of influenza activity. The CDC emphasized that people who are eligible for vaccination should get vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent severe symptoms.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:50 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%B5%81%E6%84%9F%E5%A2%9E21%E6%AD%BB-%E5%96%AE%E9%80%B114-8%E8%90%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%B0%B1%E8%A8%BA-%E7%96%BE%E7%AE%A1%E7%BD%B2-%E5%BF%AB%E6%89%93%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%97-063226700.html)\n\n**Woman in Wyoming hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu**\nWyoming has reported its first human case of H5N1 avian influenza, with a woman from Platte County hospitalized out-of-state. Health officials believe she contracted the virus through direct contact with an infected poultry flock at her residence. This case marks the third H5N1-related hospitalization in the United States, with approximately 70 human infections reported nationwide since April 2024. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, as there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has conditionally approved a vaccine developed by Zoetis for use in poultry to curb the spread of the virus among bird populations and reduce the risk of transmission to humans. Health authorities advise individuals who have contact with poultry or wild birds to take precautions, including wearing protective equipment and practicing good hygiene, to minimize the risk of infection.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[endtimeheadlines.org](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2025/02/woman-in-wyoming-hospitalized-with-h5n1-bird-flu/)\n\n**Avian Influenza May Be Spreading Silently Among Humans, Study Suggests**\nA study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that the H5N1 avian influenza virus may be spreading silently among humans in the United States. The study, which was published in 2024, analyzed blood samples from 150 veterinarians who worked with cattle in the country. Three of the veterinarians showed antibodies to the virus, indicating a recent infection, but none of them reported any symptoms associated with avian influenza, such as respiratory problems or conjunctivitis. The study's lead author notes that the results do not reflect the current situation in the US, as the blood samples were collected between June and September 2024, before a national testing program for milk was launched. However, the study suggests the need for better surveillance not only of animals but also of people who work with them. The researchers suspect that the virus may be spreading more widely and silently than the study suggests, and the actual number of infected people may be higher than the 70 reported cases in March 2024.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 06:40 PM\nSource:[ilmessaggero.it](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/salute/focus/influenza_aviaria_virus_asintomatico_contagio_silenzioso_cosa_sta_succedendo-8657638.html)\n\n**What we can VERIFY about bird flu amid current outbreak**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 67 human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the US since 2022, with the first case occurring in April 2022. There have been no cases of bird flu spreading between people in the US, but health experts warn that if the virus mutates, it could become highly transmissible and spread rapidly through the population. The CDC has developed a vaccine that fights against bird flu, but it is not available to the public yet. It is safe to eat eggs and drink milk during the bird flu outbreak, as long as they are properly cooked and pasteurized. Pets can contract bird flu through contact with infected poultry or carcasses, or from eating contaminated food. The World Health Organization has not declared H5N1 a pandemic, but some scientists say the risk of one is rising since the virus is adapting to new hosts like cows and other mammals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 10:09 PM\nSource:[ktvb.com](https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/verify/health-verify/bird-flu-outbreak-spread-to-people-food-safety-questions-answered/536-3301a937-b554-45da-a2e2-cdbb0dc37afc)\n\n**US Department of Health and Human Services Grants $590 Million to Accelerate H5N1 mRNA Vaccine Development**\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has granted $590 million to Moderna to accelerate the development of an mRNA-based vaccine for H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. According to Stephanie Kurdach, infectious disease analyst at GlobalData, 'Although H5N1 infections remain a low risk to the general public, they can cause severe disease and should be taken seriously.' The FDA has approved multiple vaccines in the past that target H5N1, but these are not effective against strains found in the 2024 outbreak. As of January 2025, all 50 states have outbreaks in poultry, and the CDC has reported rising cases in cattle and dairy cows. The CDC has reported a total of 67 confirmed reported human cases of H5N1, but the actual number may be higher due to lack of testing and public awareness. Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, said, 'Avian flu variants have proven to be particularly unpredictable and dangerous to humans in the past.

The recent case involves a child from San Francisco who had conjunctivitis and fever. According to CDC data, California has been the most affected by the bird flu outbreak, with a total of 38 cases reported. The CDC has urged laboratories across the country to determine within 24 hours whether flu patients are infected with seasonal influenza or the bird flu virus, especially in the context of increasing cases of bird flu in dairy cows and poultry farming. CDC Deputy Director Dr. Neerav Shah said that laboratories have been given guidelines to conduct this test since last fall, but the process has been slow, with many hospitals sending large batches of flu samples for testing every few days, and by the time the results come in, patients are often sent home. The longer the time passes, the more memories fade, and identifying potential sources becomes more difficult. Shah said that his close contacts may be at risk of Tamiflu-like preventive medications.
