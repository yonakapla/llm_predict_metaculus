        "description": "[Figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating) is a winter sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on ice while incorporating jumps, spins, lifts, and footwork into choreographed routines set to music. The [World Figure Skating Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships), organised annually by the [International Skating Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union) (ISU) since 1896, represents the most prestigious annual competition in the sport outside the Olympic Games. The [2025 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships) are scheduled to take place in Boston, from March 25 to March 30.\n\nIn all official competitions, athletes are scored using the [ISU Judging System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISU_Judging_System), which consists of two components: the Technical Score (TES) and the Program Components Score (PCS). The Technical Score assesses the difficulty and execution of specific elements (jumps, spins, and step sequences) with each element receiving a base value [ranging](https://www.usfigureskating.org/sites/default/files/media-files/ISU%202656%20ISU_SOV_SinglesPairs_2024-25_final.pdf) from 0.40 to 14, which is then adjusted using a -5 to +5 grade based on the athlete's execution. The Program Components Score evaluates five aspects of the performance: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music, with judges awarding points on a scale of 0.25 to 10.00 in each category.\n\nThe TES and PCS are added together to form the Total Segment Score (TSS), which is calculated for both short programs and free skating and added together to determine an athlete's final ranking.",

The show will feature the national middle school skating competition, where middle school skaters will compete to be part of the Japanese team for the upcoming World Championships. The show will also include interviews with the Japanese team's representatives and a review of the recent Four Continents and World Junior Championships. The show's absence in April means that a review of the World Championships will not be possible. The show's end marks the decline of figure skating-related programs, which will make it harder for non-skating enthusiasts to stumble upon them. However, it's worth noting that figure skaters like Yuzuru Hanyu will still make appearances on variety shows to promote the sport.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[goo blog](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/ico3/e/1ac6c139c2650b0baba5f60dbde5606b)\n\n**Mark Kondratuk: 'I Performed Better in the 2024/25 Season Than in the Olympic Season'**\nMark Kondratuk, the European champion in figure skating, stated that he performed better in the 2024/25 season than in the Olympic season. Kondratuk participated in a show program on the sixth stage of the Moscow Sports Cup. He is a bronze medalist of the 2022 Winter Olympics in the team event, European champion, and winner of the Russian championship. In the 2024/25 season, he took second place in the Russian Grand Prix Final and fifth place in the Russian championship, where he led after the short program. Kondratuk said, 'The season was wave-like. In my subjective opinion, the season went well. There was only one failure in the free program at the Russian championship. Otherwise, the stages went well, the control skates too, the Russian Grand Prix Final, and the jump tournament. If we look at the average level of skating and scores, I performed better this year than in the Olympic season. Therefore, I think everything is fine, and we just need to continue working.' Kondratuk plans to take a break and then attend training camps. He said, 'I would like to go somewhere to rest. I don't know yet where. And then there will be training camps. I don't know yet where and when. But, as usual, there will be training camps and preparation. Now, we need to perform at the team tournament and the show program tournament, and the season will be over.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 12:37 PM\nSource:[MATCHTV.RU](https://matchtv.ru/figure-skating/matchtvnews_NI2177327_Kondratuk_Vystupaju_v_etom_godu_luchshe_chem_v_olimpijskij_sezon_Za_vse_prokaty_byla_odna_neudacha_v_proizvolnoj_programme_ChR)\n\n**Daisuke Takahashi's 'Sliding House' Embarks on a New Phase**\nThe final rehearsal of the ice show 'Sliding House' (, 'Hayasaka-ya') produced by Daisuke Takahashi ended on March 7th in Hiroshima. Takahashi, the show's director, greeted the attendees with a smile, saying, 'I'm so sorry, I made a mistake!' The lighthearted moment brought a sense of unity to the group. Takahashi's humility is characteristic of his genuine passion for figure skating. As a pioneer in the figure skating world, Takahashi achieved unprecedented success, including Olympic medals and victories in the Grand Prix Final and World Championships. After his retirement, he returned to competition four years later and won the silver medal at the All-Japan Championships. He then transitioned to ice dance and rose to the top 10 in the world, becoming the All-Japan champion. Given his impressive background, the 'Sliding House' show is sure to be exceptional.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 09:33 AM\nSource:[\u96c6\u82f1\u793e\u306e\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u7dcf\u5408\u96d1\u8a8c \u30b9\u30dd\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 web Sportiva](https://sportiva.shueisha.co.jp/clm/othersports/figure/2025/03/08/post_10/)\n\n**Today in Sports - Lindsey Vonn wins her 10th career World Cup downhill to break the U.S. record**\nToday in sports history, several notable events took place.

She said that in the past, she was subjected to bullying because of her short height, but now the situation has changed. 'Before, there were many insults about my height and nationality. Now, they analyze every word and glance. I don't try to be good. I don't need everyone to like me, and I don't like pretending to be something I'm not,' Petrosyan said. Despite facing these challenges, Petrosyan has achieved great success in her career, winning the Grand Prix final in women's singles figure skating on February 16 and defending her title as Russian champion in the same discipline in December last year. The International Skating Union (ISU) has also allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in the qualification tournament for the 2026 Winter Olympics in a neutral status. The qualification tournament for figure skating will take place in China from September 17 to 21 next year, with the Olympics scheduled to take place in February 2026 in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 12:14 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/sport/news/2025/03/07/25256144.shtml)\n\n**Vladislav Dikij Becomes First to Perform Quadruple Axel on Lake Baikal Ice**\nRussian figure skater Vladislav Dikij has become the first person to perform a quadruple axel on the ice of Lake Baikal.

According to her, the atmosphere of the national team's training camp, which takes place in the UT 'Novogorsky', does not add enthusiasm to her life. 'From 2010 to 2018, every summer was two stable months in Novogorsky. Novogorsky for all figure skaters is simply a prison, a hell', Medvedeva said. Medvedeva has a impressive career, with two Olympic silver medals, two gold medals at the World and European Championships, and a bronze medal at the World Championships.

According to our information, the application was submitted in an expanded format, not in the 1+1 format (main + reserve) as required by the ISU. Several reserve athletes have also filled out applications for neutral status. Sources suggest that the main athletes will be Evgeny Puzanov for men, Victoria Safonova for women, and Ekaterina Andreeva/Dmitry Blinov for dance. It is uncertain whether Belarus will participate in the qualification for pairs. As one source noted, the applications were not only filled out by the main athlete, but also by two reserve athletes - as was the case for dance, men, and women. This is in contrast to Russia, which also submitted an expanded application, including 5-6 top athletes in each discipline, as reported by 'Sport-Express' earlier. However, this has not been officially confirmed, and the decision will be announced when the information from the ISU is received, according to Alexander Kogan, the general director of the Russian federation.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[\u0421\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442-\u042d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441](https://www.sport-express.ru/olympics/winter/figure-skating/news/belorussiya-podala-rasshirennuyu-zayavku-na-uchastie-v-olimpiyskom-otbore-po-figurnomu-kataniyu-2306846/)\n\n**Roman Kostenkov Comments on Same-Sex Duets in Figure Skating**\nRoman Kostenkov, a 2006 Olympic champion in ice dance, commented on same-sex duets in figure skating, mentioning Olympic champions Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron.

Let them compete, let them do what they want in France - or wherever they do it, in the US or Canada. I'm not following them. If she likes skating with a woman, and maybe he wants to skate with a man - let them skate! I won't hinder them.' Kostenkov noted that Papadakis and Cizeron's last competition was in March 2022 at the World Championships in Montpellier, France, and they announced their retirement in December 2024.
