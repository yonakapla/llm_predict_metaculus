The series, starring Colin Farrell, has won several precursor awards and is a strong bet to win. Other contenders include Kevin Kline, Robert De Niro, and Brian Tyree Henry. However, recent history has shown that the limited series race can be unpredictable, and underdog contenders like 'Adolescence' newcomer Cooper or Jake Gyllenhaal for 'Presumed Innocent' could surprise. In the TV movie category, 'Rebel Ridge' and 'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy' are leading the pack, but it's been a while since the Emmys TV movie category was awarded during the Primetime Emmy Awards broadcast. 'The Penguin' stars Cristin Milioti and Colin Farrell are also leading the movie/limited series acting races. As Emmy winner Richard Gadd said, 'Baby Reindeer became one of last year's most widely seen shows, and when the Emmy Awards announced its winners in the limited series and movie categories in September, Gadd, Gunning, and Baby Reindeer won.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/outrageously-early-emmy-odds-penguin-150059324.html)\n\n**'Jury Duty' To Return For Season 2 On Amazon; Theme Of New Installment Revealed**\nThe Amazon Freevee comedy 'Jury Duty' is returning for a second season on Prime Video.

The creative team from Season 1, including executive producers David Bernad and Gene Stupnitsky, and showrunner Cody Heller, are believed to be back. The first season, which chronicled an American jury trial through the eyes of an unaware juror, earned four Emmy nominations in 2023, including Outstanding Comedy Series and Supporting Actor In a Comedy Series for James Marsden.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 16, 2025 02:23 PM\nSource:[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/jury-duty-season-2-amazon-setting-theme-1236296867/)\n\n**Ted Lasso Season 4 Officially Ordered by Apple TV+**\nAfter over a year of speculation, Apple TV+ has officially ordered a fourth season of its Emmy Award-winning comedy, 'Ted Lasso'. The show's stars, Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift, are expected to reprise their roles. Sources indicate that Juno Temple is in negotiations to return as Keeley Jones, and Brendan Hunt, co-creator and executive producer, is set to sign for another season as Coach Beard. 'Ted Lasso has been a game-changer, inspiring a passionate community of fans worldwide and spreading joy, laughter, and unwavering kindness,' said Matt Cherniss, Apple TV+'s head of programming. Jason Sukeikis, the show's creator, simply stated, 'As we all live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to 'look before we leap,' in season four, the AFC Richmond players will learn to 'LOOK BEFORE WE LEAP,' discovering that wherever they land is exactly where they're meant to be.' The long wait is over for fans, who were left wondering if the show would return for a fourth season after the third season's cliffhanger ending. Cherniss added, 'It's a testament to the show's enduring popularity and the passion of our fans that we're able to bring Ted Lasso back for another season.'

Hacks has been consistent in quality and accolades, with 16 nominations and three wins in 2024, and 17 nominations and three wins in 2022. The Bear, which won 10 Emmys in 2023, ranks second in the odds, but its track record may be affected by its recent third season receiving less glowing reviews. Only Murders in the Building, which recently won the comedy ensemble prize at the 2025 SAG Awards, ranks third in the odds, but its chances of winning Best Comedy may depend on whether it gets nominated for writing and/or directing. Abbott Elementary, a public school-set mockumentary, ranks fourth in the odds, having gradually increased its nominations count year after year, but its nominations have never reached double digits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[GoldDerby](https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/hacks-best-comedy-series-emmy-odds/)\n\n**Jennifer Hudson in disbelief as she shares joyous personal update**\nJennifer Hudson won two awards at the 2025 NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Host in a Talk or News/Information (Series or Special) and Outstanding Talk Series for her eponymous talk show.
