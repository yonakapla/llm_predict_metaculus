This comes after the U.S. halted all military aid to Ukraine, and as Zelenskiy tries to shore up international support. South Africa has maintained good relations with Russia, despite not condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. According to spokesman Vincent Magwenya, the visit is part of ongoing efforts to find a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine. Zelenskiy's visit comes at a pivotal moment in the war, following his public feud with Donald Trump and the U.S. decision to halt military aid to Kyiv.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 10:20 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraines-zelenskiy-visit-south-africa-101438244.html)\n\n**Zelensky to Visit South Africa Next Month to Discuss Ukraine-Russia Peace**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to visit South Africa next month, according to Bloomberg.

'The visit is a continuation of the current agreements between President Ramaphosa and Presidents Putin and Zelensky on an inclusive peace process that will provide a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine,' said Ramaphosa's spokesperson. South Africa has maintained a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine. Ramaphosa launched a peace initiative two years ago, but it has not yielded results. The meeting between Zelensky and Ramaphosa comes at a time when they are trying to improve relations with US President Donald Trump.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/zelenskiy-nastupnogo-misyatsya-vidvidae-pivdennu-1741339127.html)\n\n**Russia Launches Airstrikes on Ukraine's Energy Infrastructure Ahead of Saudi Arabia Meeting**\nRussia has launched massive airstrikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in anticipation of a meeting between US and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The meeting, which comes after a summit of 27 European leaders in Brussels who expressed a desire to strengthen the continent's defense capabilities in the wake of Washington's disengagement from the conflict, aims to establish 'a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire', according to US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.

Trump stated, 'I told them (the Saudis) that I will go if you invest $1 trillion in American companies over four years, and they agreed to do so, so I will go there.' Trump added that the Saudi investments will be for 'buying military equipment and other things.' He described his relationship with the Saudis as 'great.' Trump mentioned that his visit to Saudi Arabia will be one of his first foreign trips since taking office in January 2024. He also stated that he will visit the kingdom before the UK, which is his usual first destination. In 2017, Trump visited Saudi Arabia in his first foreign trip as president, where he received a grand welcome and secured deals and investments worth over $380 billion in various fields, which was a 10-year investment. Regarding the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump stated that Ukraine 'wants to reach an agreement.' He considered that Kiev 'has no other option' but to end the war, and that Russia also 'wants to reach an agreement.' Trump added that Russia 'has a different way that no one knows except me and myself,' and that it also 'has no other option.' When asked about the possibility of revoking the temporary legal status of over 200,000 Ukrainians in the US who fled the war, Trump said that he will make a decision 'very soon.' He added that 'we do not want to harm anyone, and we will look into this matter.' Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, announced that Saudi Arabia will host a meeting between American and Ukrainian officials next week to discuss the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1/3502594)\n\n**Trump to Visit Saudi Arabia in April, Breaking Tradition**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that he will visit Saudi Arabia in April, his first overseas trip.

This will be Trump's first foreign visit, breaking the tradition of previous US presidents visiting the UK as their first foreign destination. Trump is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, but the exact date of the meeting is not confirmed.

Bin Salman expressed his intention to invest $60 billion in the US over the next four years. Trump previously spoke at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Miami, hosted by the Saudi sovereign fund, where he referred to Saudi Arabia as a 'special country' and thanked them for hosting a high-level meeting between the US and Russia.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 01:47 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250307_0003089847)\n\n**Trump to Visit Saudi Arabia, US and Ukraine Officials to Meet, Russia Refuses Temporary Ceasefire**\nUS President Donald Trump said it would be great if everyone could disarm nuclear weapons as they are a crazy power.

The visit, which included seven Russian experts with high military education, took place on two flights from Moscow to Tehran on April 24 and September 17, 2023. The experts, including two colonels and two lieutenant colonels, had expertise in various areas such as missile defense systems, artillery, and rocket technology. Their visit coincided with a difficult time for Iran, which was engaged in a confrontation with Israel, resulting in rocket attacks on both sides in April and October. A high-ranking official in Iran confirmed the visit, stating that the Russian specialists had visited Iranian rocket factories multiple times. The cooperation between Russia and Iran has intensified in the context of the special military operation, with the US sanctions and attempts to isolate both countries on the international stage contributing to their rapprochement. The US President Donald Trump has invited Russia to participate in negotiations on Iran, citing its military and trade ties with the country. According to Bloomberg, Russia has agreed to participate in the negotiations. Trump's initiative may be driven by his realization of the danger posed by the military cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 03:14 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/dzen/tramp-vovremja-spohvatilsja-stalo-izvestno-o-vizitah-russkih-raketchikov-v-iran_1175515)\n\n**Global News Update: Trump Rules Out Russia Visit, Europe Prepares for 'Triple Blow' in Support of Ukraine**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that he will not visit Russia on May 9.

Trump made a public statement, specifically answering journalists' questions about whether he will visit Moscow to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory in the Great Patriotic War. 'No, I will not go,' Trump clearly stated, according to the White House pool. This statement comes after a French journal, Point, reported that Trump was allegedly planning to visit the Russian capital. However, there was no official information from the Kremlin or the White House about this. Meanwhile, Russian President's official representative, Dmitry Peskov, stated that there are no agreements between the Kremlin and the White House about Trump's possible visit to Moscow on May 9, 2025, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 11:13 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6244198/)\n\n**Trump to Visit Russia on Victory Day, According to 'Le Point'**\nAccording to the French weekly 'Le Point', US President Donald Trump is planning to visit Russia on Victory Day, May 9, 2025.

According to French publication Le Point, Russian troops will welcome Trump on the traditional Red Square parade. 'What victory will Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump celebrate on May 9, 2025? Not so much the allies of 1945, but their joint agreement on Ukraine peace talks, which, according to the Kellogg Plan, will end... on May 9,' the article states. This is not Trump's first visit to Moscow for this occasion, but in a different context. In 1995, Bill Clinton visited Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on May 9, despite disagreements on Bosnia, Iran, and NATO expansion. 'If a new agreement between the US and Russia is signed and Trump's invitation is accepted, Europeans will symbolically drain their glasses on May 9, 2025, watching on their screens as Russian troops welcome the American president,' the author concludes. Trump has previously refused to answer questions about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is responsible for the war in Ukraine, and believes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is also to blame.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 06:51 PM\nSource:[telegraf.com.ua](https://news.telegraf.com.ua/ukr/politika/2025-02-21/5899115-tramp-priedet-k-putinu-9-maya-budut-prazdnovat)\n\n**Donald Trump to Visit Russia on Victory Day, According to French Media**\nAccording to French media, if Donald Trump's plan to visit Russia succeeds, it would be a victory for Putin, who justified the invasion of Ukraine by comparing Ukrainians to Nazis.

Stepanov believes that their meeting will be a significant event, saying, 'If Trump comes to Russia on Victory Day, that will be a sensation.' Stepanov noted that both leaders prioritize their countries and have found common ground due to their shared approach to decision-making, which he described as, 'A person says - a person does.' The two leaders discussed Ukraine, agreeing on the need for peaceful negotiations to resolve the conflict. Trump invited Putin to visit the US, and Putin extended an invitation to Trump to visit Moscow during their phone call on February 12th.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 10:23 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/02/16/stepashin-zaiavil-chto-priezd-trampa-v-rossiiu-na-den-pobedy-proizvedet-furor.html)\n\n**Russia Anticipates a 'Furore' if Trump Visits on Victory Day**\nFormer Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov announced a 'furore' if US President Donald Trump were to visit Russia on Victory Day, May 9, 2025. Stepanov expects a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump to take place before May 9, similar to last year. 'If Trump were to come to Victory Day, that would be a furore,' he said. Stepanov believes that the two presidents have similar priorities, with a focus on their respective countries, and that they understand each other and take their statements seriously. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously stated that Putin is willing to welcome Trump at the Victory Day parade on May 9.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/02/16/v-rossii-anonsirovali-furor-v-sluchae-priezda-trampa-na-den-pobedy/)\n\n**US Special Envoy to Ukraine May Visit Russia Before Putin-Trump Meeting**\nUS special envoy to Ukraine, Kit Kellog, may visit Russia before the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President-elect Donald Trump, according to Americanist and political scientist Malak Dudakov. Dudakov stated that all diplomatic activity will begin after Trump's inauguration on January 20. 'It's too early to judge and speculate, we will first see the activity of diplomats', Dudakov said. He did not rule out the possibility that Moscow and Washington could find common ground on issues related to the Ukrainian conflict, but also noted that the complex situation in Russia-West relations will likely persist. Trump previously stated that the conflict on Ukraine was sparked by the administration of US President Joe Biden, and emphasized that Russia launched the Special Military Operation because his predecessor and his allies were incompetent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 02:54 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/politics/politolog-dudakov-kellog-mozhet-priehat-v-rf-do-vstrechi-putina-i-trampa)\n\n**Putin to Discuss New National Projects on January 9**\nRussian President Putin will discuss the launch of new national projects on January 9.

Previously, Putin spoke with 9th-grader Arina Porhal from Gorlovka via phone, fulfilling her wish to visit St. Petersburg as part of the 'Christmas Tree of Wishes' charity event. US President-elect Donald Trump stated that he is aware of Putin's willingness to engage in dialogue, but believes that negotiations can only take place after his inauguration. Trump noted that he cannot yet specify the exact date for the proposed dialogue with Putin.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[360.ru](https://360.ru/news/vlast/putin-9-janvarja-obsudit-zapusk-novyh-natsproektov/)\n\n**Trump Aims to Negotiate Peace Agreement between Ukraine and Russia before Easter**\nFormer US President Donald Trump plans to negotiate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia before Easter, according to Robert Clark, a scientific associate at the Yorktown Institute. Clark stated, 'It will be incredibly difficult for Ukraine. I think the American side will certainly aim to conclude any agreement by Easter. It all depends on how willing Vladimir Putin is to make concessions, especially in areas like Kursk, and how willing President Volodymyr Zelensky is to make concessions.' The agreement may be signed by April 20, 2025. Trump has appointed General Keith Kellogg as a special representative to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine after Trump takes office. According to Kellogg's plan, the front line will be frozen by stopping fire and introducing a demilitarized zone. Russia will receive limited sanctions relief in exchange for its agreement, and full relief will only be granted after the signing of a peace agreement acceptable to Ukraine. Ukraine was not asked to give up its claim to occupied territories, but it must achieve this through diplomatic means. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that before any possible negotiations with Russia, he plans to discuss with President Trump how to jointly stop Putin. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine's position will be crucial for European partners, as the war is taking place on Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine has the right to the loudest voice in these negotiations. 'We will agree with Trump, and after that, there can be a conversation with the Russians,' Zelensky said.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[delo.ua](https://delo.ua/news/tramp-bude-namagatis-uklasti-mirnu-ugodu-miz-ukrayinoyu-ta-rf-do-velikodnya-440157/)\n\n",

Initially, experts considered historical visit patterns, geopolitical tensions, and personal interests, resulting in low initial probabilities ranging from 0% to 15%. After reviewing news articles, which confirmed Trump's focus on other international engagements, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and his explicit statements ruling out a visit to Russia, all experts revised their probabilities to 0%. Therefore, the consensus is that Trump is not expected to visit Russia within the given timeframe.",
