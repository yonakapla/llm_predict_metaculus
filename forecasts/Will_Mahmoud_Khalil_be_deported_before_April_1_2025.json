The government claims the move was due to a bedbug infestation at the original facility, but Khalil disputes this, saying he feared immediate deportation. Khalil was detained for supporting the Hamas terrorist group and has been accused of disrupting college classes, harassing Jewish American students, and distributing pro-Hamas propaganda. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, 'He took advantage of the opportunity to study at one of our nation's finest universities and colleges by siding with terrorists, Hamas terrorists.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/the-times-of-israel/agencies/columbia-anti-israel-activist-facing-deportation-contests-his-detention-relocation/181423977)\n\n**Federal Judge Blocks Deportation of Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil**\nA federal judge in New York has accepted the request of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University student who was arrested on March 8, and has ordered the transfer of the case to New Jersey. Khalil, a resident of the United States with a green card, led the pro-Gaza protests at New York University last spring and is currently detained in Louisiana. The Trump administration had requested his immediate deportation, but two days after his arrest, Judge Jesse Furman of New York ordered that Khalil not be deported while the case is ongoing, saying, 'It was a great day for justice.' \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 08:07 AM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/giudice-federale-new-york-accettato-richiesta-mahmoud-khalil-428442)\n\n**Georgetown Student Detained and Faces Deportation Over Critical Views on Israel**\nBadar Suri, a student at Georgetown University, was detained by US authorities on April 18, 2024, and is facing deportation to India, his country of origin. Suri's detention is linked to his critical views on Israel, which he expressed on a website called 'Campus Watch' run by the Middle East Forum. His wife, Mapheze Ahmad Yousef Saleh, a student at the same university, is a US citizen of Palestinian origin and has been linked to Hamas. The US Department of Homeland Security has revoked Suri's student visa, citing a clause that allows for the expulsion of foreign nationals if their presence in the country is deemed a risk to US foreign policy. Suri's lawyers argue that his detention is solely based on his opinions and his wife's background. The case has sparked concern among academics and human rights groups, who see it as a threat to freedom of expression on university campuses. This is not the first case of its kind, as a French researcher was deported from the US in March 2025 for expressing critical views on the Trump administration's scientific research policies. Another case involves Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and student at Columbia University, who was arrested in March 2025 for distributing flyers in support of Hamas.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[ABC \ufeffTU DIARIO EN ESPA\u00d1OL](https://www.abc.es/internacional/trump-detiene-trata-expulsar-academicos-criticos-israel-20250320024153-nt.html)\n\n**The Case of Mahmoud Khalil: A Threat to Freedom of Expression in the US**\nMahmoud Khalil, a 29-year-old Palestinian activist, was arrested on March 8 in New York and is currently being held in an immigration detention center in Louisiana while his case progresses. According to Donald Trump, Khalil is facing deportation. He was intercepted at his home by federal immigration agents without a judicial warrant to justify the arrest. They told him he was being detained because his student visa had been revoked, but when his lawyer asked for clarification, they said 'we're not going to discuss that right now.' Khalil has had a residence card since 2024. His lawyer has expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the arrest and the potential consequences for Khalil's freedom of expression. 'This is a clear example of the erosion of civil liberties in the United States,' said Khalil's lawyer. 'The government is using immigration laws to silence critics and suppress dissent.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[El Espectador](https://www.elespectador.com/mundo/america/el-caso-mahmoud-khalil-detenido-por-ice-enfrenta-deportacion-por-politicas-de-trump-a-pesar-de-tener-la-green-card-dice-que-es-preso-politico/)\n\n**Pro-Palestinian Activist Targeted For Deportation By Trump Admin Speaks From Prison For The First Time**\nPro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who holds a green card, has spoken from prison for the first time since being taken into custody earlier this month. Khalil said he was forced to sleep on a 'cold floor' at an ICE office in New York City and was denied a blanket. He also stated that visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will be targeted for their political beliefs. The Trump administration claims Khalil was taken to a facility in Louisiana due to a bedbug infestation, but Khalil disputes this, saying he never heard anyone mention bedbugs. The detention has sparked a showdown over first amendment rights, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Khalil and others will be deported for supporting Hamas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[International Business Times](https://www.ibtimes.com/pro-palestinian-activist-targeted-deportation-trump-admin-speaks-prison-first-time-3766914)\n\n**Who Was Mahmoud Khalil Before ICE Took Him Away?**\nMahmoud Khalil, a student at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, was detained by ICE on March 8, 2024, after his student visa and green card were revoked. Khalil, a legal resident of the US, had been invited to speak at the university by historian Zachary Foster, and was known for his kindness and generosity in speaking Arabic with others. However, Khalil's case raises urgent questions about the targeting of immigrants and those with differing political views, as President Trump labeled him a 'pro-Hamas' terrorist sympathizer. A New York federal judge has blocked Khalil's deportation until his case can be heard in court, and he has been transferred to a detention center in New Jersey. Khalil has called himself a 'political prisoner,' saying 'Justice escapes the contours of this nation's immigration facilities.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[Teen Vogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/mahmoud-khalil-detained-ice-columbia-friends-coworkers)\n\n**Anti-Israel Student Speaks Out After Being Arrested, Blames 'Anti-Palestinian Racism'**\nColumbia University student Mahmoud Khalil has spoken out about his arrest and potential deportation, claiming it is a result of 'anti-Palestinian racism' in the government. Khalil was arrested by DHS agents who refused to provide a warrant, and he was detained for hours without knowing the cause of his arrest or if he was facing imminent deportation. He believes his arrest was a direct consequence of exercising his right to free speech as he advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza. Khalil's detractors argue that he poses a threat to national security and that his speech went further than simply advocating for the Palestinians, essentially supporting terrorism. The Trump administration argues that Khalil's presence in the U.S. constitutes 'serious adverse foreign policy consequences' because of his advocacy for the Palestinians, and that he can be deported under Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Critics argue that this move violates Khalil's First Amendment rights and that the administration is retaliating against him for exercising his right to free speech.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Townhall](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/jeff-charles/2025/03/19/mahmoud-khalil-speaks-out-after-detention-blames-anti-palestinian-racism-n2654070)\n\n**Columbia Apologized to Mahmoud Khalil in May 2024 for One-Day Suspension**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University, was suspended for one day in April 2024 for his involvement in protests against Israel's war on Gaza. The suspension was later rescinded and disciplinary charges were dropped after the university president's office apologized. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said that the suspension was a common tactic used against student protesters. Khalil's immigration status was also at risk due to the suspension, which could have qualified him for deportation. Despite the suspension being dropped, Khalil was later arrested by ICE in March 2025 and is now facing deportation. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of being a supporter of Hamas, but has provided no evidence. Khalil's case has sparked concerns among civil liberties advocates and has become a national First Amendment battle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2025/03/19/columbia-mahmoud-khalil-suspension-gaza-protests/)\n\n**US to Deport Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil for Pro-Palestinian Protests**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was detained by US immigration authorities on March 8, 2025, for participating in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York. His green card was revoked, and he was scheduled to be deported, but a court order prevented this until his case was reviewed. Khalil was not charged with any crimes, but his detention and deportation were based on a decision by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence in the US could have 'serious negative consequences for foreign policy.' US President Donald Trump personally commented on Khalil's detention, calling him a 'pro-Hamas radical.' Trump stated, 'This is the first arrest, but there will be many more. We know that there are many students at Columbia and other universities across the country who have participated in terrorist, anti-Semitic, and anti-American activities.' Khalil, a 24-year-old from Syria, has been living in the US since 2022, when he began studying at Columbia University on a student visa. He has also worked for various international non-profit organizations and has a degree from the American University in Beirut. Khalil's wife, a US citizen, is pregnant, and he has been a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, including participating in protests and giving interviews to the press. He has denied any involvement in anti-Semitic activities and has stated that he only criticizes Zionism as a ideology of Jewish supremacy. The US government has launched an investigation into Khalil's activities, and he has filed a lawsuit against Columbia University, seeking to prevent the university from disclosing information about his disciplinary record to the authorities.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[Meduza](https://meduza.io/feature/2025/03/14/administratsiya-ssha-sobiraetsya-deportirovat-uchastnika-propalestinskih-aktsiy-v-kolumbiyskom-universitete)\n\n**Trump's Administration Detains Palestinian-American Student, Sparking Protests and Criticism**\nMahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Syrian-American, was arrested by US immigration authorities on April 18, 2024, while he and his pregnant wife were returning to their apartment in Manhattan, New York. Khalil, a student at Columbia University, was accused of being a 'radical foreign pro-Hamas student' by US President Donald Trump. Trump claimed that Khalil was detained as part of his administration's efforts to combat antisemitism and that he would be deported. However, Khalil's lawyers argue that he was targeted for his pro-Palestinian activism and that his detention is a violation of his First Amendment rights. A federal judge has blocked Khalil's deportation, pending a review of the case. The incident has sparked widespread protests and criticism of Trump's administration for allegedly targeting Palestinian-American students. Khalil's lawyers argue that there is no evidence that he has provided material support to a terrorist organization. Trump's administration has argued that Khalil's presence in the US poses a threat to national security and that he can be deported under a 1952 immigration law. However, the case is still pending in court and it is unclear whether Khalil will be deported.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[nyheder.tv2.dk](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-03-13-trump-kalder-anholdelse-af-30-aarig-for-den-foerste-af-mange-og-det-vaekker-bekymring-i-usa)\n\n**Rayan Fakhoury | Not Conducive to the Public Good**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student and permanent resident of the US, was arrested by ICE officers at his student apartment in Manhattan on March 8, 2025. He was taken to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, 1300 miles away, without his wife or lawyers knowing. Khalil has not been charged with any crime, but the authorities claimed to revoke his green card on the grounds that he 'led activities aligned to Hamas'. This move has been widely criticized as an attempt to silence Khalil's opposition to the Israeli occupation and his participation in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest campaign. The Trump administration's actions mark the latest episode in a long-running saga of state repression of political speech in support of Palestinian rights. Similar cases have been reported in the UK and Germany, where individuals have been arrested, detained, or deported for expressing their opinions about the situation in Palestine and Israel. These events reveal the convergence of two phenomena: the 'Palestine exception', where civil liberties are eroded in the context of advocacy for Palestinian rights, and the use of immigration powers as an instrument of state repression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:36 PM\nSource:[London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2025/march/not-conducive-to-the-public-good)\n\n**US Judge Blocks Deportation of Columbia University Student**\nA US judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of a Columbia University student, Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained by immigration authorities. Judge Jesse Furman ordered the government to stop Khalil's deportation, citing concerns that the detention was unconstitutional. Khalil's lawyers argue that he was arrested and detained as retaliation for his vocal criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. The US government has not charged Khalil with a crime, but has accused him of supporting Hamas. Khalil's lawyers say that his detention is a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. The case has sparked protests outside the Manhattan federal court, with hundreds of people chanting 'Free Mahmoud Khalil' and 'Down with deportation, long live liberation.' Khalil, a Palestinian student, arrived in the US in 2022 on a student visa and obtained permanent residency last year. He was a prominent figure in the Columbia University protests against Israel's military actions in Gaza. The US government claims that the pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, including Columbia, included support for Hamas and anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students. However, student organizers say that criticizing Israel is not the same as being anti-Semitic.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1654577-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9/)\n\n**Can the Trump administration legally deport Palestinian rights advocate Mahmoud Khalil? 3 things to know about green card holders' rights**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights advocate and recent graduate of Columbia University, is facing deportation after being arrested on March 8, 2025. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that the government will deport lawful permanent residents who support Hamas and engage in anti-Jewish activities. Khalil's lawyers argue that his arrest and pending deportation are unconstitutional. The article highlights three major differences between the rights of citizens and lawful permanent residents: limited political rights, limited public benefits, and reversal of immigration status. The Trump administration argues that they can deport Khalil under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a lawful permanent resident can be deported if the secretary of state has reasonable ground to believe that this person 'would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 08:05 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/can-the-trump-administration-legally-deport-palestinian-rights-advocate-mahmoud-khalil-3-things-to-know-about-green-card-holders-rights-252019)\n\n**Pro-Hamas activist's deportation not a 'free speech' matter and law is on Trump's side: experts**\nPro-Hamas activist Mahmoud Khalil, who led protests on Columbia University's campus, has been arrested by ICE and is facing deportation. Legal experts argue that Khalil's actions, including endorsing and espousing terrorist activity, make him deportable under U.S. immigration law. The Trump administration has signed an executive order to deport pro-Hamas protesters, and Khalil's case is seen as a test of this policy. Experts say that Khalil's presence in the U.S. poses 'serious adverse foreign policy consequences' and that he can be deported without committing a crime. Khalil's attorney argues that his arrest is an attack on the First Amendment, but experts say that the case is about national security, not free speech.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-hamas-activists-deportation-not-free-speech-matter-law-trumps-side-experts)\n\n**What to know about Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia protester arrested by**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, was arrested by federal immigration officials and faces deportation. The government claims Khalil led 'activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization' and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda during protests. However, a federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation, citing the need for due process. Khalil's lawyers argue that the government is targeting him for his free speech and discriminating against his viewpoint. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was born in Syria to Palestinian grandparents and came to the US on a student visa in 2022. He became a green card holder last year and is married to a US citizen who is eight months pregnant. Khalil is being held at a federal immigration detention facility in Louisiana and is expected to make an initial appearance before an immigration court. 'For everyone reading this, I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby,' his wife wrote in a statement.

Khalil was a prominent figure in student protests against the Gaza war and was accused by President Donald Trump of being a 'radical pro-Hamas' student. Trump's administration has revoked Khalil's student visa and is seeking to deport him. Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, has called the move a 'terrible and inexcusable - and calculated - error' and a 'clear persecution of activists.' The university has denied any involvement in Khalil's detention and has expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's policies on students. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups and the Columbia University community. A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation, and a hearing is scheduled for this week. Khalil's wife, a US citizen who is eight months pregnant, is also facing deportation threats. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of violating the conditions of his visa by participating in protests and has cited a 2025 executive order that allows for the deportation of individuals who support 'pro-jihadist' protests and 'all Hamas sympathizers on university campuses.' Experts have questioned the legality of Khalil's detention, calling it an 'extraordinary measure with uncertain legal grounds.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https://laopinion.com/2025/03/11/quien-es-mahmoud-khalid-el-estudiante-palestino-de-la-universidad-de-columbia-que-fue-detenido-para-ser-deportado-pese-a-ser-residente-permanente-en-ee-uu/)\n\n**Detainment of Mahmoud Khalil | Know Your Meme**\nColumbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025, reportedly for organizing a pro-Palestinian protest and Gaza Solidarity Encampment in April 2024.

ICE threatened to revoke Khalil's green card and deport him, with many blaming the Zionist and Israeli ties in President Donald Trump's administration. President Trump's White House called Khalil and his supporters 'pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, [and] anti-American,' and he posted on Truth Social, 'We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country.' The hashtag 'Shalom Mahmoud' was also used to mock Khalil's detainment, with many internet users defending him and criticizing the Trump administration's actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 05:47 PM\nSource:[Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/detainment-of-mahmoud-khalil)\n\n**More protests planned after pro-Palestinian activist, Columbia grad detained by ICE**\nMahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents over the weekend.

When Grier asked if Khalil's permanent residency would also be revoked, the ICE agent replied that it would be. Khalil's wife, who is 8 months pregnant, was not informed of the reason for Khalil's arrest. Khalil was transferred to a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Grier stated that they have not received any information about the specific charges against Khalil. This arrest is the first instance of a foreign student being deported for participating in anti-Israel protests, as promised by former President Donald Trump. Khalil was involved in negotiations with university officials over the removal of a tent encampment on campus last spring. Columbia University has been pursuing disciplinary action against Khalil and several other students for their pro-Palestinian activities. The US government has also revoked $400 million in federal funding to the university, citing its failure to address anti-Semitism on campus. Trump had previously warned that schools and universities that allow 'unlawful protests' would lose all federal funding.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:13 AM\nSource:[\uc138\uacc4\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.segye.com/view/20250310517126)\n\n**US Arrests Palestinian Student Mahmoud Khalil Amid Escalating Crackdown on Anti-Israel Protests**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University, was arrested by US immigration authorities on March 10, 2025, according to the Associated Press.

His lawyer, Amy Guirguis, told the AP that she spoke with an ICE agent during the arrest, who informed her that Khalil's arrest was based on a directive from the US Department of State to revoke his student visa. When she mentioned that he is a permanent resident with a green card, the agent replied that it would also be revoked. The AP reported that Khalil's arrest is one of the first steps taken by the Trump administration to implement its promise to deport international students who participated in anti-Israel protests that swept US universities last spring. Khalil was a key negotiator between students and university administrators during the campus protests, and was a prominent figure among student activists who openly expressed their views. The Trump administration has been cracking down on Columbia University, accusing it of failing to address anti-Semitism on campus. Last Friday, federal agencies announced that they would stop granting and renewing contracts worth $400 million to the university, reflecting the growing tensions between the US government and the university administration. Khalil's lawyer said that the authorities refused to inform his wife whether he was charged with a specific crime, and that he was transferred to an immigration detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, without providing further details on the reasons for his detention. 'We were unable to get any further information about the reason for his detention, but this is a clear escalation,' Guirguis said. 'It seems that the administration is implementing its threats.' A university spokesperson said that law enforcement agencies are required to provide a warrant before entering the campus, but refused to comment on whether the university received such a warrant before Khalil's arrest. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted: 'We will revoke the visas or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so that they can be deported.' According to Camille Mackler, founder of the Immigrant Advocacy Organization, the US Department of Homeland Security can initiate deportation proceedings against permanent residents in multiple cases, including 'supporting a terrorist organization.' The final decision will be made by an immigration judge, who will determine whether Khalil's residency should be revoked. Mackler added: 'This seems to be a retaliatory measure against someone who expressed an opinion that didn't please the Trump administration.' The investigation against Khalil and Columbia University comes amid a crackdown by the Trump administration on the university, which has accused it of failing to address anti-Semitism on campus. The federal agencies have stopped granting and renewing contracts worth $400 million to the university, reflecting the growing tensions between the US government and the university administration. The charges against Khalil focus on his involvement in a group called 'Campaign Against Racial Segregation at Columbia University,' where he was accused of helping to organize an unauthorized march that was described as anti-Hamas. He was also accused of playing a key role in circulating posts on social media that criticized Zionism. In a previous statement to the AP, Khalil said: 'I have about 13 charges against me, most of which relate to social media posts that I had no connection to.' He added: 'They just want to show the Congress and the right-wing politicians that they are taking action, regardless of the risks to the students.' Khalil's arrest reflects a clear escalation in US policies towards Palestinian activists and supporters of the Palestinian cause within US universities, where the Trump administration is taking a hardline stance against anti-Israel protests, using immigration and security laws to do so. Amid the growing tensions between the Trump administration and US universities, this event may be just the beginning of a series of similar actions against students and activists who express views that do not align with the official US stance on Israel.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:58 AM\nSource:[elbalad.news](https://www.elbalad.news/6508517)\n\n**US Immigration Authorities Arrest Palestinian Graduate Student Mahmoud Khalil**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University, was arrested by US immigration authorities on the night of March 9, 2025, at his apartment in a university-owned building near campus. According to his lawyer, Amy Grier, ICE agents told her that they were taking action under a State Department order to cancel Khalil's student visa. When Grier pointed out that Khalil is actually a permanent resident, not a student visa holder, the ICE agent said that his permanent residency would also be canceled. The ICE agents also threatened to arrest Grier's 8-month pregnant wife, who is a US citizen. Khalil's lawyer said that they do not know why he was arrested and that the Trump administration is using coercion. Columbia University spokesperson refused to comment on Khalil's arrest and whether ICE agents presented a warrant when they entered the university-owned building. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted on March 9 that the Trump administration would cancel the visas and permanent residency of 'Hamas supporters' in the US. The Department of Homeland Security can initiate deportation proceedings against lawful permanent residents for various crimes, including supporting terrorist organizations. A judge will decide whether to cancel Khalil's permanent residency. Khalil has been a prominent figure in the Palestinian solidarity movement on US campuses, including leading negotiations with university officials to remove a tent encampment on campus last spring. Columbia University has been pursuing disciplinary action against Khalil and dozens of other students for their pro-Palestinian activities. The US government has also revoked $400 million in federal funding to Columbia University, citing the university's failure to prevent anti-Semitism on campus. President Trump had warned on social media on April 4 that schools and universities that allow 'unlawful protests' would lose all federal funding.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 02:29 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250310064200009)\n\n",

    "summary": "The experts assessed the likelihood of Mahmoud Khalil being deported before April 1, 2025, and consistently concluded that the probability is low. Initially, most experts estimated a low probability due to the complexity and public attention surrounding the case, resulting in legal and procedural delays typical in high-profile deportation cases. After reviewing additional information, including a federal judge's decision to block the deportation, the experts reaffirmed their low probability estimates. The experts noted the Trump administration's aggressive stance towards deportation but concluded that ongoing legal hurdles and public scrutiny would likely prevent deportation by the specified date. Revised probabilities remained low, with most experts maintaining their initial assessments or making minor adjustments.",
