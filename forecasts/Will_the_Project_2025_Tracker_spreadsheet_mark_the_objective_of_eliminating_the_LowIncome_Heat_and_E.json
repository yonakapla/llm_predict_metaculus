Eligible low-income households can receive a one-time payment of $300, $400, or $500, depending on the service used, to help with heating costs. To be eligible, households must meet the following requirements: their income must be below the poverty threshold, which is $15,650 for a single person, $21,150 for two people, and $26,650 for three people, with an additional $5,550 for each additional household member. Devon Kilpatrick, manager of the energy program, said, 'Access to affordable heating is essential for the well-being of people and families, especially during the winter months.' He also stated that 'this program provides critical financial support to help households manage heating costs and maintain a safe and comfortable home environment.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/carolina-del-norte/carolina-del-norte-se-acerca-la-fecha-limite-para-pedir-ayuda-con-el-pago-de-la-tarifa-electrica-en-nid14032025/)\n\n**Ministry of Finance Issues Clean Energy Development Special Fund Management Measures**\nThe Ministry of Finance has officially issued the 'Clean Energy Development Special Fund Management Measures' on March 12, 2025, to promote the transition to clean and low-carbon energy. The measures specify that central government funds will be allocated to support the development of renewable energy, clean fossil fuels, and the utilization of fossil fuels. The fund will be implemented from 2025 to 2029. According to the measures, the fund will focus on five key areas: the demonstration and promotion of clean energy key technologies, the development and utilization of clean energy, the construction of public platforms, comprehensive application demonstrations, and other tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee. The funding will be allocated through competitive distribution, award-for-performance, and actual settlement, with a differentiated incentive policy for unconventional natural gas such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight gas. Specifically, projects that increase production by more than last year will be rewarded at a tiered rate, while those that decrease production will have their funding reduced. Additionally, projects that increase production during the heating season will receive an extra 'winter increase bonus' policy. The special fund will be used exclusively for its designated purpose and will be managed in two categories: central projects and local projects. Central enterprises with 100% state ownership can directly apply for funding, while local projects will be coordinated by provincial finance departments. The funding will be disbursed in a pre-advance and post-settlement model, requiring provinces and central enterprises to optimize funding distribution based on production efficiency and ensure that funds are used for technology upgrades, safety production, and emission reduction and efficiency improvements. This policy revision has strengthened support for coalbed gas development, aiming to promote the utilization of coal mine gas through economic incentives while achieving dual goals of energy production and environmental protection.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 05:56 AM\nSource:[\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89c2\u5bdf\u62a5](http://www.eeo.com.cn/2025/0314/716399.shtml)\n\n**Swiss Federal Council Partially Implements Environmental Protection Act Modification**\nThe Swiss Federal Council has partially implemented the modification of the Environmental Protection Act (LPAmb) and abolished two ordinances, effective April 1, 2025. The goal is to accelerate the cleanup of contaminated sites. Other changes to the LPAmb concern tax incentives, environmental crime prosecution, and information and documentation systems. According to the new regulations, the fund for contaminated sites will support investigations and cleanups until 2032 and 2045, respectively. The fund will also support the cleanup of private playgrounds and gardens contaminated by hazardous substances. The Confederation will participate financially in the investigation and cleanup of sites near waste incineration plants or contaminated fire training centers. Environmental crime prosecution has been strengthened to combat the billion-dollar global environmental crime market. Simplifying information exchange between law enforcement and environmental authorities will make environmental crime prosecution more efficient. New information and documentation systems will simplify and accelerate data exchange between federal and cantonal authorities, applicants, and those subject to declaration obligations. The ordinances on tax incentives for 'extra-light' heating oil, gasoline, and diesel have been abolished, as they are obsolete due to stricter regulations in the anti-pollution ordinance. The provisions on noise protection will enter into force in the spring of 2026, after the anti-noise pollution ordinance is revised. All other changes to the LPAmb and the abolition of the two ordinances will take effect on April 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The Swiss Federal Gouvernment](https://www.admin.ch/gov/it/pagina-iniziale/documentazione/comunicati-stampa.msg-id-104482.html)\n\n**Government Eliminates 11 Programs from Secretariat of Childhood**\nThe government has eliminated 11 programs from the Secretariat of Childhood, as formalized through resolutions published in the Official Gazette on March 13, 2025. According to the resolutions, the elimination of these programs aims to achieve 'good management and efficient administration of resources.' The decision responds to the need to reorganize and unify regulations that involved duplication of functions and inefficient use of public resources. The goal is to avoid the overlap of initiatives and ensure a more efficient and transparent administration. However, the dissolution of these programs has raised concerns among various sectors, as many of them were focused on protecting and promoting the rights of children, adolescents, and vulnerable populations. Social organizations and child experts have expressed their worry about the potential negative impact of these measures on the affected population. The elimination of these programs reflects a shift in the government's social and cultural policies, centered on optimizing resources and restructuring initiatives.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[El Litoral](https://www.ellitoral.com/politica/gobierno-elimino-11programas-secretaria-ninez_0_MVASyRF1mI.html)\n\n**MO\u042d\u041a to Eliminate 30 Abandoned Thermal Network Sections in Moscow**\nMoscow United Energy Company (MO\u042d\u041a) plans to eliminate 30 abandoned sections of thermal networks in Moscow's above-ground laying, known as bypasses, by 2025. The project is part of a three-year program (2024-2026) implemented jointly with the Moscow Department of Housing and Utilities. 'During the work, heat supply to consumers will be switched to newly built sections of thermal networks in underground execution. In total, within the framework of the program, it is planned to inspect objects, develop and agree on design and estimate documentation, and perform work on reorganization of abandoned bypasses at more than 80 addresses,' the press service said. Most of the abandoned bypasses were not removed underground on time by organizations that previously connected their construction objects to heat supply. As a rule, these companies were liquidated and did not fulfill their obligations to the city for various reasons. MO\u042d\u041a (part of 'Gazprom Energy Holding') is the unified heat supplier of Moscow, ensuring centralized heating and hot water supply to the capital.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:45 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://realty.ria.ru/20250313/moek-2004692522.html)\n\n**Moscow to Eliminate Over 30 Abandoned Bypasses in 2025**\nMoscow's Complex of Urban Economy will eliminate over 30 abandoned bypasses in 2025, according to Deputy Mayor Petr Biryukov. The city has been working on a program to remove these bypasses since 2014, and over 200 have already been demolished. Biryukov explained that bypasses are temporary pipelines for heat and water supply, usually built for repairs or construction. However, some companies that built them failed to remove them in time, leaving them abandoned. 'These temporary structures have not been removed in a timely manner by the companies that built them, and these companies have been liquidated without fulfilling their obligations,' Biryukov said. The Moscow Energy Company will conduct the demolition in several stages, starting with project development, followed by the installation of new permanent pipelines during the off-peak season, and finally, the removal of the old bypasses. Biryukov emphasized that only abandoned bypasses will be removed, while construction bypasses will continue to be used during building or repair projects.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430](https://vm.ru/news/1213011-v-2025-godu-v-moskve-likvidiruyut-bolee-30-uchastkov-beshoznyh-bajpasov)\n\n**Jeju City Supports Low-Income Households with Energy Efficiency Improvement Project**\nThe Jeju City government is recruiting applicants for its energy efficiency improvement project, which aims to support low-income households with energy-efficient air conditioning and heating systems.

He added that 'the state will continue to support some petroleum products to maintain a reasonable and balanced price for solar energy', as it is a basic commodity that affects many services. In response to a question from journalist Ahmed Mousa, Al-Hamssani said, 'Yes, the support for fuel will end by the end of 2025, and then the price will be determined by the global market. However, even after the support for fuel ends, there will still be support for solar and butane gas, as they have a direct impact on the prices of goods and low-income citizens. This support will be covered by a subsidy on other petroleum products.' Al-Hamssani emphasized that the ultimate goal is to achieve a balance between the real cost of fuel and its selling price, stating, 'Prices will be adjusted, but solar energy will still be subsidized, as it cannot be sold at its real price; it would affect low-income citizens and the prices of goods.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:37 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=13032025&id=6f622c52-7bc9-4513-8263-f59fc79d86b3)\n\n**Government Spokesperson Announces Complete Stop of Support for Petroleum Derivatives by 2025**\nThe government spokesperson, Mohamed Al-Hamssani, announced that the support for petroleum derivatives will be completely stopped by the end of 2025.

The budget for the program could be cut from 900 million euros to 720 million euros, which would result in a decrease of 10 to 55 euros in the check amount. The reduction was announced by Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin in mid-January, citing the decrease in electricity prices starting in February. However, this decrease will not affect the entire population (80%), and gas prices will actually increase for indexed offers starting in February. The energy check amount has not been increased since its creation, despite rising energy prices. The reduction is not yet confirmed and will depend on the decision of parliamentarians during the 2025 budget vote in early February. The energy check will still be renewed in 2025, with the exact payment schedule to be determined, but it will likely be distributed in the spring, between early April and mid-May.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 10:18 AM\nSource:[L'internaute](https://www.linternaute.com/argent/guide-de-vos-finances/1427598-cheque-energie-2025-une-baisse-de-l-aide-de-20-se-profile-quand-sera-t-elle-versee/)\n\n**Changes to the French Energy Check Program for 2025**\nThe French government is considering changes to the energy check (ch\u00e8que-\u00e9nergie) program for 2025.

Historically, significant program eliminations within the public administration space in the U.S. face multiple hurdles, including legislative opposition, public backlash, and bureaucratic inertia. While specific base rates for program eliminations are scarce, large federal program changes are completed within set timeframes approximately 30% of the time due to these obstacles.",

    "summary": "After reviewing both phases, the experts largely agree that the probability of the Project 2025 Tracker marking the objective of eliminating the Low-Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program as complete on April 1, 2025, is very low. In Phase 1, the initial probabilities varied among experts, but generally fell between 0% and 30%. The experts noted significant political, social, and administrative challenges to such an elimination, including political opposition, public resistance, and bureaucratic inertia. In Phase 2, after considering news articles indicating ongoing support for similar programs, most experts did not significantly change their forecasts, with final probabilities ranging from 0% to 25%. The consensus is that the elimination of the program by the specified date is highly unlikely, given the continued reliance on such programs and the absence of substantial evidence supporting imminent elimination.",
