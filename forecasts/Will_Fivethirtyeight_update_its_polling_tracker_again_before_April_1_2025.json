According to Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez, Secretary of Governance, there will be up to 84,202 polling stations across the country. The voting process will involve six ballots of different colors, each with its own content. The ballots will include the election of federal judges, as well as local judges in 19 federal entities. Rodr\u00edguez explained that citizens will have to choose candidates for each ballot, with specific requirements for each one. For example, the purple ballot will require the election of five women and four men for the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN), while the blue ballot will require the election of one woman and one man for the Magistratures of the Superior Chamber of the Electoral Tribunal of the Judicial Power of the Federation. The government expects over 100,000 citizens to vote in these elections. As Rodr\u00edguez said, 'It is essential to take into account that in the white boxes, you must indicate the number of candidates you want to choose, and in each one, put the number of the candidate you want to choose.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:01 PM\nSource:[SDPnoticias.com](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/mexico/elecciones-poder-judicial-2025-gobierno-de-mexico-explica-como-votar-en-cada-una-de-las-boletas)\n\n**Trump Tariff Tracker -- March 19**\nPresident Trump has announced plans to implement reciprocal tariffs and tariffs on automobiles on April 2.

According to Saulite, the new ballots will feature two fields - red and green - for voters to mark their preferences. 'The old system of ballots caused confusion among voters, as it was not always clear. The new ballots are much easier for citizens. Information on how to fill out the ballots will be available at polling stations,' Saulite explained. The new ballots are set to be used in the next year's elections and in the 2029 European Parliament elections. Additionally, mobile voting stations will be introduced, which will be temporarily set up in crowded areas chosen by local authorities. 'Information about mobile polling stations must be provided 30 days before the elections, so that the CEC can inform the public,' Saulite noted. Another innovation will be 'split' polling stations, which can operate at different addresses at different times. Municipal elections in Latvia are scheduled to take place in early June, with candidate lists to be submitted by April 8.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 01:16 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250319/glava-tsik-izbirateley-zhdut-izmeneniya--29941444.html)\n\n**Mauritian Municipal Elections 2025: Five Days to Register for Supplementary Electoral Register**\nCitizens in five Mauritian cities have five days to register for the supplementary electoral register, which will be in effect from April 4, 2025.

They must bring their birth certificate or ID card and proof of address. It is recommended that voters check if their name is already on the current electoral register before registration. The five cities of Mauritius are concerned, with 19 registration centers opening in the following times: Thursday, Friday, and Monday from 4pm to 6pm, and Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 4pm. To be eligible to run in the municipal elections, a candidate must be a resident of the same city.

In the previous presidential elections in 2020, the turnout was 64.51% in the first round and 68.18% in the second round. Polish citizens who have turned 18 and have not been deprived of this right by a court judgment are entitled to vote. However, individuals who have been incapacitated or deprived of public rights cannot participate in the elections. Additionally, those who turn 18 after the election date will have to wait for the next opportunity to cast their vote. Voters can cast their ballots in designated polling stations, but those who are outside their place of residence on election day have convenient options. They can obtain a certificate of the right to vote, which allows them to vote in any location in the country or abroad, or they can register to vote in a new location, no later than five days before the election. Polish citizens abroad can also vote in polling stations at Polish consulates, provided they have previously notified the consul. Special polling stations have been designated for people in hospitals, social welfare homes, and prisons. Students can vote at their place of study if they have previously registered in the relevant electoral register. Military personnel and officials on duty on election day will also be able to vote in polling stations at military units.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/prawo/wybory-w-polsce-2025-kto-moze-glosowac-na-prezydenta/n6w884s)\n\n**Tecan publishes agenda for the Annual General Meeting 2025**\nTecan has published the agenda for its Annual General Meeting 2025, which will take place on April 10, 2025.

The model takes into account sample sizes, previous results, and 'house effects' (bias towards a party) of each pollster. The article notes that there is a lot of uncertainty in political polling and modelling, and the charts show a range that likely contains the support for each party. The two-party preferred (2pp) vote has been declining since 2022, with Labor and the Coalition's 68.5% primary votes share being an all-time low.

This move comes after over a year of FiveThirtyEight's website being redirected to ABC News' 538 hub. The decision follows several high-profile elections where polling has proven to be unreliable. According to ABC News' 538 hub, President Trump and Vice President Vance have low favorability ratings, with President Trump set to deliver a highly partisan address to Congress. 'Polling in general, and polling data aggregation in particular, has been proven to be an unreliable indicator of election outcomes,' said no one, but the move suggests that Disney is reevaluating its investment in this area.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 02:57 PM\nSource:[MediaPost](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/403902/what-are-the-odds-of-this-disney-shutters-538.html)\n\n**2025 Canada election poll tracker**\nMark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, is expected to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canadian prime minister. He has not ruled out calling a snap election as soon as April 21st, but if he doesn't, opposition parties may force his hand with a no-confidence vote, potentially triggering an election on May 5th. Registered Liberals are currently voting for their next leader, with Carney's ratings much stronger than those of his opponent, Chrystia Freeland, and the incumbent government. Carney, who will be announced as the new leader on March 9th, has repudiated some of Trudeau's economic policies, blaming profligate spending for Canada's vulnerability to American tariffs. 'If he does not call an early election, his hand may be forced by opposition parties, who may well call for a no-confidence vote when parliament returns,' according to the article.

The analysis found that at least 20 promises have been placed in the wrong category, including multiple promises that the Labor government ended up keeping. The ABC's 'Promise Tracker' has not been updated in over 12 months, but still displays the current date. This has raised concerns that the data is misleading voters, particularly in the lead-up to the next election. As one example, the average household paid an extra $334 a year on electricity between the moment that the promise to lower power bills was made and April 2024, despite the promise being reported as 'in progress'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 03:43 AM\nSource:[Sky News Australia](https://www.skynews.com.au/business/media/abc-promise-tracker-misleading-voters-on-albanese-governments-performance-in-leadup-to-election/news-story/29d2a15123c8e1cc851aa5f182274fb1)\n\n**Delhi Election 2025 LIVE updates: Voting to begin at 7:00 AM amid tight security**\nThe Delhi Assembly Election 2025 has begun, with voting taking place across 70 constituencies from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM.

The new model uses a random walk to predict daily changes in presidential approval, taking into account various factors such as overall public opinion, sampling error, and non-sampling error. The model also accounts for uncertainty in the polling average, allowing for the display of uncertainty intervals directly on the average. This new methodology is an improvement over the previous approach, which had some shortcomings, including the potential for statistical error and sensitivity to noise. The new model is similar to the one used for polls of the 2024 general election and has been used to model approval ratings of government leaders in the United Kingdom and for elections in Australia. According to Nate Silver, the founder of 538, 'Our new model also lets us account for uncertainty in the polling average in a very straightforward way. Imagine we are not calculating support for a president one single time, but thousands of times, where each time we see what his support would be if the data and parameters of our model had different values.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-approval-polling-average-works/story?id=117999010)\n\n**Rockstar Closes Doors to GTA 5 Update Trackers**\nRockstar Games has taken a surprising step that has left the GTA 5 community in a state of confusion.

This means that players and enthusiasts can no longer rely on SteamDB or other platforms to track updates, and will have to rely on official information from Rockstar. While the exact reasons behind this change are unclear, it is believed that Rockstar is trying to keep its development plans secret to prevent leaks before official announcements. However, this change may also encourage players to enjoy the game as it is, without worrying about future updates.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[vga4a.com](https://www.vga4a.com/archives/254263)\n\n",
