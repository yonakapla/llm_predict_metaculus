According to the author, Yale is the best team in the league and should win the tournament '75% of the time.'

While some coaches prefer this format, others, like Harvard's Tommy Amaker and Brown's Martin, believe that all eight teams should be included. The Ivy League sponsors postseason tournaments in most of its other sports, but restricts the competition to the top four finishers in regular season play. The current format has led to recent success for the Ivy men's basketball champion, with Yale and Princeton both making deep runs in the NCAA Tournament in recent years. However, coaches and administrators point out that the cost of running an eight-team tournament is a consideration, and that the decision ultimately lies with the eight school presidents and athletic directors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/13/metro/march-sadness-ivy-league-tournament-harvard-brown-princeton-dartmouth/)\n\n**Men's Champ Week tickets punched: 14 of 31 conference tournament winners crowned**\nFourteen conference tournament champions have been crowned in men's college basketball's Champ Week, with more teams competing to cut down the nets in their respective league finals.

The team's offensive struggles were on display, with a season-low 56 points scored against Brown and 57 points scored against Yale. Junior guard Xaivian Lee was a bright spot, scoring 19 points against Yale. Head coach Mitch Henderson expressed concerns about the team's consistency, saying, 'We have a problem on our team.' The team's title hopes are fading, and they are now tied for third place in the Ivy League standings with only one game separating them and fifth-placed Brown. The top four teams will punch their ticket to Ivy Madness and get a chance to go dancing in the NCAA tournament in March.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[dailyprincetonian.com](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/02/princeton-sports-recap-mens-basketball-ivy-league-brown-bears-yale-bulldogs-xaivian-lee)\n\n**March Madness locations, schedules, and dates revealed**\nThe 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, also known as March Madness, is set to begin on March 16, 2025, with Selection Sunday on CBS.
