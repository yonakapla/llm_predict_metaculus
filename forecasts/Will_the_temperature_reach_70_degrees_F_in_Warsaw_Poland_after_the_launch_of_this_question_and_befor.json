Monday will still be a cloudy day, but more sunshine will be visible in the west and south. The high-pressure weather will accompany us at least until the end of the week, with a large amount of sunshine expected. Until Thursday, clouds will be lingering in the north, but in many other areas, the sky will be completely cloudless. In the second half of the week, it will be the same in the north. Given the current length of the day in Poland, this means that the sunshine will last for up to 11 hours. It's worth using this time for outdoor activities. Considering the growing drought, the lack of precipitation will be a problem. We can expect a very dry week, with little to no precipitation expected in most areas. Only in some northern areas, there may be symbolic precipitation, not exceeding 1 mm. Additionally, we can expect a significant increase in temperature. With each passing day, it will get warmer, and the peak will occur in the second half of the week, when the mercury will rise to 15-18\u00b0C in many regions, with local temperatures reaching 19-20\u00b0C. However, the residents of the coast will not experience such high temperatures, with a maximum of 10-11\u00b0C expected. The perceived temperature will be lowered by a strong wind.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 09:47 AM\nSource:[Onet Wiadomo\u015bci](https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/pogoda/zaskakujaca-pogoda-w-kolejnych-dniach-wyjatkowe-cieplo-to-nie-wszystko/t1c9k4x)\n\n**When Will Spring Arrive? Long-term Weather Forecast Reveals the Answer**\nThe Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) has published a long-term weather forecast. According to the forecast, the average temperature in March is expected to be 1-1.5 degrees Celsius higher than the multi-year average from 1991-2020. The eastern part of Poland is expected to be exceptionally warm. The total precipitation in March is forecast to be 5-10 mm lower than the multi-year average. In April and May, the average temperature is expected to be 1-2 degrees Celsius higher than in previous years. The total precipitation in April is expected to be comparable to the multi-year average, while in May it is expected to be 5-10 mm higher. In the central and southwestern parts of the country, the average total precipitation is expected to be 10-20 mm higher than the multi-year average. The summer is expected to start with a warm temperature in June, with an anomaly of 1-1.5 degrees Celsius in most of the country. The average total precipitation is expected to be similar to that of previous years.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:19 PM\nSource:[gazetapl](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114883,31702164,kiedy-przyjdzie-wiosna-juz-wszystko-wiadomo-jest-prognoza.html)\n\n**Weather Forecast for Warsaw on February 8, 2025**\nAccording to the weather forecast for Warsaw on Saturday, February 8, 2025, there is expected to be a cloud cover of 50.4%.

The wind speed will reach a maximum of 7.4 m/s. Meteorologists warn that the fluctuations in atmospheric pressure may cause migraines, blood pressure spikes, and a decrease in mood. The actual temperature will be 10\u00b0C, while the perceived temperature, taking into account the actual temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, will be 11\u00b0C. This is because, in winter, we feel a lower temperature than the actual one when there is a typical winter wind and high humidity, and in summer, we feel a higher temperature when there is no wind and high humidity, which is known as 'humidity' that accompanies precipitation. In Warsaw, the temperature will be 10\u00b0C, and the perceived temperature will be 11\u00b0C. The forecast predicts no rain, no hail, and no snow. The sun will rise at 07:21 and set at 16:19.
