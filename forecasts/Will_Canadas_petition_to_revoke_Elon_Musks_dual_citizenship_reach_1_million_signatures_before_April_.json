Transport Canada 'assessing' last-minute claims**\nThe Canadian government is 'assessing' Tesla's $43 million in EV rebate claims, which is a 1,900-per-cent surge in claims over the final weekend of the federal subsidy program in January. Transport Canada confirmed it is examining all possible options for dealerships who did not submit their eligibility application before the deadline. The large sum hangs in the balance as a potential bargaining chip in the burgeoning trade war between Canada and the United States. Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, said, 'Let's not give them free money for the honour of being insulted.' Anita Anand, the former transport minister, declined requests for interviews, and Chrystia Freeland, the current transport minister, did not respond to an interview request or questions regarding the rebates and the Canadian dealers out of pocket. 'Transport Canada continues to assess the large batch of claims submitted by dealerships after the announcement of the iZEV Program's pause on January 12, 2025,' said Transport Canada spokesperson Flavio Nienow. 'Transport Canada is examining all possible options for dealerships who did not submit their eligibility application before the deadline.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/will-the-canadian-government-hand-elon-musks-tesla-43m-in-ev-rebates-transport-canada-assessing/article_02d22a66-034b-11f0-a0f1-2f3c6a528f87.html)\n\n**Toronto Stops Subsidies for Tesla Electric Cars Amid US-Canada Trade Tensions**\nToronto Mayor Olivia Chow announced on Monday (17th) that the city will no longer provide subsidies for people to buy Tesla electric cars as taxis or shared vehicles, due to the tense trade situation between Canada and the US. Toronto has been promoting measures to reduce carbon emissions, encouraging citizens to purchase electric vehicles for taxi use, and providing license fee and renewal fee exemptions until 2029. However, Chow stated that Tesla will no longer be eligible for the subsidies starting from March 1st, emphasizing that the measure will continue until Canada resolves its trade issues with the US. She suggested that taxi companies and drivers consider alternative vehicles or other brands of electric cars. Chow claimed that this move is aimed at Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was appointed as an advisor by US President Donald Trump, and the Trump administration's calls for Canada to be annexed and imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods, which has sparked discontent among Canadians. Chow stated that citizens can still purchase Tesla electric cars if they wish, but they should not expect to receive tax subsidies. She estimated that this move will not have a significant financial impact and believes that the symbolic significance of the measure is more important.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:21 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/3921813/%E5%8A%A0%E6%8B%BF%E5%A4%A7%EF%BD%9C%E5%A4%9A%E5%80%AB%E5%A4%9A%E5%81%9C%E5%90%91Tesla%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B%E9%9B%BB%E5%8B%95%E8%BB%8A%E8%A3%9C%E8%B2%BC%20%E5%9B%A0%E6%87%89%E7%BE%8E%E5%8A%A0%E8%B2%BF%E6%98%93%E7%B7%8A%E5%BC%B5)\n\n**How US Tariffs, Threats Of Annexation Have Sparked A Renewed Sense Of Canadian Nationalism | Explained - News18**\nThe strained relations between the US and Canada have sparked a renewed sense of Canadian nationalism, according to recent polls. President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats of annexation have prompted a strong response from the Canadian government, including retaliatory tariffs and a 'buy Canadian' movement. A Reuters poll suggests that some Canadians believe the damage caused in the US-Canada ties is irrevocable. Trump's goal to make Canada the 51st US state has been met with opposition, with many Canadians calling for a boycott of US products and buying local alternatives. A petition is also circulating to revoke the Canadian citizenship of Elon Musk, who has worked with Trump. Experts believe that Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada raises concerns about the US' reliability as a trading partner.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/explainers/how-us-tariffs-threats-of-annexation-have-sparked-a-renewed-sense-of-canadian-nationalism-explained-9264603.html)\n\n**Toronto slashes Tesla incentives as US trade war simmers**\nToronto has decided to stop providing financial incentives for buying Tesla vehicles due to ongoing trade issues with the US. According to Chow, 'We are giving incentives for people to migrate into electric cars. Except, we will stop giving incentives, financial incentives to buy Tesla.' The exclusion will continue until trade issues with the US are resolved. This decision is seen as a response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ties to US President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canadian products. Meanwhile, the city is promoting the adoption of electric vehicles by giving drivers and owners a reduction in licensing fees and renewal fees until the end of 2029. However, businesses that have been most impacted by US tariffs will be supported, and workers will be protected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:37 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/toronto-slashes-tesla-incentives-us-003757973.html)\n\n**Toronto Excludes Tesla From EV Incentives Amid Trump Tariff War: Mayor Says, 'Don't Count On Taxpayer Money' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**\nToronto has excluded Tesla vehicles from its electric vehicle incentives due to the ongoing trade war with the United States. According to Mayor Olivia Chow, 'don't count on taxpayer money' to subsidize Tesla purchases. The exclusion remains until U.S. trade issues are resolved. This move is part of a broader trend in Canada where Tesla is facing increasing challenges, including exclusion from rebate programs in British Columbia and public sentiment shifting against the company. A recent poll found that 71% of Canadians support a ban on Tesla sales, and a petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship has gained significant support.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:20 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/25/03/44368264/toronto-excludes-tesla-from-ev-incentives-amid-trump-tariff-war-mayor-says-dont-count-on-taxpayer-money)\n\n**After Indian Columbia student flees, Elon Musk endorses self-deportation app**\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has endorsed a new mobile application, CBP Home, designed for self-deportation, which was repurposed by the Trump administration to enable individuals to 'self-deport' lawfully. According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, 'The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream.' The app was initially developed to facilitate asylum appointments, but was seen as an easy and cost-effective way to advance President Trump's efforts to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian student at Columbia University, became one of the first individuals to use the app after self-deporting to Canada, following the revocation of her student visa. The Trump administration has indicated that more deportations could follow, as US agencies plan to investigate Columbia University protests for potential terrorism violations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 06:11 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/donald-trump-immigration-self-deportation-cbp-home-app-united-states-ranjani-srinivasan-2694520-2025-03-17)\n\n**A global citizen: How many citizenships does Elon Musk have?**\nElon Musk holds citizenship in three countries: South Africa, the United States, and Canada. He inherited his Canadian citizenship at birth due to his mother's Canadian citizenship. Musk became a US citizen through naturalization after living and working in the US for several years. A petition has been initiated to revoke his Canadian citizenship, citing his involvement with foreign governments and influence on Canadian sovereignty. However, Canadian law states that citizenship can only be revoked if it was acquired through fraud or misrepresentation, making it unlikely that Musk's citizenship will be revoked. The Canadian government is currently reviewing its citizenship laws, including the second-generation cut-off rule, which may lead to changes in the future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:19 AM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2534789/mr-worldwide-how-many-citizenships-does-elon-musk-have)\n\n**Canadians in several cities join 'Tesla Takedown' protests against Musk, Trump**\nCanadians in several cities, including Ottawa and Vancouver, joined the 'Tesla Takedown' protests to denounce CEO Elon Musk and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump. The protests, which have been scheduled across the United States and Europe, aim to reduce Musk's wealth by discouraging people from buying Teslas. Jen Gagnon, a dual Canadian-American citizen, helped organize the event in Surrey, B.C., and said she felt compelled to push back against Trump, Musk, and 'creeping' fascism in Canada. 'It's just every time I think it can't get worse, they find the bottom and keep digging,' she said. Juan Alperin, a professor at Simon Fraser University, expressed concerns about the decline of deliberative democracy and the rise of authoritarianism, saying that platforms like X, owned by Musk, are controlled by the tech oligarchy. Musk has faced criticism for allowing extremist comments to flourish on X and has been accused of interfering with politics in North America and Europe. The protests have inspired a steady stream of honks of support from passing drivers, and Tesla has been a target for protests and vandalism since Musk became a key figure in Trump's administration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[airdriecityview.com](https://www.airdriecityview.com/national-news/canadians-in-several-cities-join-tesla-takedown-protests-against-musk-trump-10383509)\n\n**Canada's 'Nuclear Option' in Trade War with US: Blocking Pornhub**\nIn the midst of a trade war with the US, Canadians are joking that they have 'nuclear power' in their arsenal, as the popular adult website Pornhub is registered in Montreal. The idea was first proposed by comedian Matthew Pugliese, who recently posted a viral video on Instagram suggesting that Canada should 'attack X' (a reference to Elon Musk's social media platform and a nod to adult content) as a 'nuclear option' in the trade war. Pornhub is the most visited adult website in the US, with over 3 million views per month. The website's servers are owned by the Aylo conglomerate, which is headquartered in Montreal. Comedian Matthew Pugliese said, 'If Canada can block Pornhub in the US, we win the trade war. That's it. There won't be a trade war.' Canadians have even created a petition calling on the Canadian government to block Pornhub as a 'peaceful but powerful' response to the trade conflict. However, the petition has yet to gain significant traction online, with only over 500 signatures. Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, has blocked access to adult content in 16 US states due to a new age verification law. These states have recently begun requiring users to provide official documents, such as a passport or driver's license, to confirm they are 18 years old to access the content.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[tsn.ua](https://tsn.ua/tsikavinki/torgova-viyna-na-novomu-rivei-kanada-mozhe-zablokuvati-ssha-dostup-do-pornhub-zmi-2789151.html)\n\n**250,000 Canadians Sign Petition to Revoke Elon Musk's Citizenship**\nOver 250,000 Canadians have signed a petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship and passport due to his close relationship with former US President Donald Trump. The petitioners claim that Musk's ties with Trump, who planned to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports in March and suggested making Canada the 51st US state, 'violate Canada's national interests.' Musk, who holds citizenship in South Africa, Canada, and the US, has become one of Trump's most prominent allies since his return to the White House in January. 'Musk uses his wealth and power to influence our elections,' the petition reads. 'He is now a member of a foreign government trying to erase Canada's sovereignty.' Musk responded on social media platform X, saying, 'Canada is not a real country.' CNN has reached out to Musk's representatives for comment. The petition, addressed to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, demands that he 'immediately revoke Musk's citizenship and cancel his Canadian passport.' The petition's organizer says their action should be seen as a form of 'accountability.' Musk obtained his Canadian passport through his mother's Canadian citizenship and later gained US citizenship through a student visa, which he obtained 10 years later. According to the Canadian House of Commons, an electronic petition requires at least five Canadian citizens' support and a Member of Parliament's authorization for initial review before it can begin collecting signatures. The deadline for the petition to cancel Musk's citizenship is June 20, 2025. If the petition meets the 500-signature threshold, it will be submitted to the House of Commons for debate during the next parliamentary session. However, Canadian law prohibits the government from revoking citizenship obtained lawfully, and a 2014 law that allowed for the revocation of dual citizens' citizenship for national security offenses was repealed in 2017.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 06:46 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8572443)\n\n**Canadian petition to revoke Elon Musk's citizenship gathers more than 250,000 signatures**\nA parliamentary petition in Canada has gathered over 250,000 signatures calling for the revocation of Elon Musk's citizenship and passport.

The petition, which was launched by Canadian writer Red and MP Angus of the New Democratic Party on February 20, has gained over 157,000 signatures in just three days, exceeding the minimum requirement of 500 signatures. According to Canadian law, the petition must be responded to by the government. The petition aims to have the Canadian Parliament review and potentially revoke Musk's Canadian citizenship. The petition will remain open until June 20.

The petition, submitted by Kwalia Red, a writer from British Columbia, is backed by NDP MP Charlie Angus, a prominent critic of Musk. Musk, born in South Africa, obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother, May Musk, who was born in Regina. As Trump's advisor, Musk became one of his most influential advisors, leading the Government Efficiency Administration (DOGE), responsible for reducing government spending and federal workforce. The petition claims that Musk is involved in activities that contradict Canada's national interests due to his close ties with the Trump administration, which it says is working to undermine Canadian sovereignty. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose high tariffs on Canadian goods and even suggested that Canada could become the 51st US state. In a previous move, Trump suspended his plan to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports for 30 days, excluding oil, gas, and electricity, which would be subject to a 10% tax. The petition urges Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to revoke Musk's Canadian passport and dual citizenship immediately. According to Canadian laws, the petition must gather at least 500 signatures to be presented to the House of Commons, which could lead to a formal response from the government. However, the Canadian parliament has been adjourned after Trudeau announced his intention to step down within the next few months after nine years in power. The parliament is scheduled to resume on March 24, but early elections are possible before then. The petition will continue to collect signatures until June 20, but such parliamentary petitions do not obligate the Canadian government to take any action, according to local media reports. In recent months, Musk has used his 'X' social media platform to attack Trudeau, calling him 'unacceptable', and has expressed support for Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://arabic.euronews.com/2025/02/24/petition-to-strip-elon-musk-citizenship-hits-170000-signatures-canada)\n\n**Nearly 200,000 Canadians want Elon Musk's citizenship revoked | National**\nA petition calling for the revocation of Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship has garnered nearly 200,000 signatures in four days.

Angus said, 'The attempts of Elon Musk to attack Canadian sovereignty must be addressed.'

The petition, presented by writer Qualia Reed, was supported by New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus, who strongly criticized Musk. Musk was born in South Africa but gained Canadian citizenship through his Regina-born mother Maye Musk. He has become one of Trump's most influential advisors and was appointed head of the Government Efficiency Department (DOGE), tasked with reducing government spending and federal workforce. Reed's petition states that Musk, as Trump's advisor, has engaged in activities contrary to Canada's national interests. It claims that Musk has become a member of a foreign government seeking to eliminate Canada's sovereignty. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose heavy tariffs on Canadian imports and has referred to Canada as the 51st US state. In response to concerns about border security and drug trafficking, Trump has agreed to delay for 30 days a plan to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports except for oil, natural gas, and electricity. The petition calls on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to revoke Musk's Canadian passport and cancel his dual citizenship status. Trudeau has announced that he will step down in the coming months, and the Canadian Parliament is currently suspended. The House of Commons is set to reconvene on March 24, but before they return, a general election call can be made. According to euronews, the petition's signature deadline is June 20, but such parliamentary petitions do not obligate the government to respond.
