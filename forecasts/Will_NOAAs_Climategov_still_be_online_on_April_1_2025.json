According to Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, the NOAA collects crucial data on temperature, salinity, and sea levels, which are essential for monsoon forecasting. Ramesh pointed out that NOAA contributes to about 40% of subsurface observations in the Indian Ocean, while India contributes around 11%. He emphasized that India will have to enhance its own research capacity and capability in earth sciences significantly to compensate for the potential loss of data. Ramesh said, 'Right now the Modi government's priority appears to be a trade deal to deal with President Trump's threats on tariffs. But his actions in other areas too could have adverse impacts on India.' He added, 'Actually it is not just for India-- NOAA is a global public good essential to monitoring and managing climate change. It faces an uncertain future.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/3288819-cong-flags-us-downsizing-noaa-says-india-must-boost-research-capacity-in-earth-sciences)\n\n**Climate change: La Ni\u00f1a fades, as global heat keeps rising**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has announced that the weak La Ni\u00f1a weather event, which began in December, is likely to be brief. According to WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo, 'These forecasts translate into millions of dollars' worth in economic savings for key sectors like agriculture, energy and transport, and have saved thousands of lives over the years by enabling disaster risk preparedness.' The WMO forecasts a 60% chance of ENSO-neutral conditions during March-May 2025, increasing to 70% for April-June 2025. Meanwhile, global heat continues to rise, with January 2025 being the warmest January on record. The WMO expects above-average temperatures across nearly all land areas worldwide during the upcoming season, with most maritime regions set to be warmer than normal, except in the eastern Pacific.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 04:16 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160836)\n\n**2025 YDS/1 Exam Schedule and Details**\nThe 2025 YDS/1 exam, administered by \u00d6SYM, will take place on March 9th.

The committee voted in favor of a corresponding amendment to the Federal Ministry Act, proposed by \u00d6VP, SP\u00d6, and NEOS. However, the National Council and the Federal Council must still approve the decision. The new government was sworn in on Monday under the old law. The new law will come into effect on April 1, and changes can be made until September 1, according to the Parliamentary Directorate. The FP\u00d6 and the Greens have raised questions and criticisms, with the FP\u00d6 focusing on the adjustments to the Freedom of Information Act and the responsibility for the public service. The Greens have criticized the fact that the changes will not take effect until April 1 and that climate and environmental protection will be separated from energy and transportation issues. 'The new division of the government is a step in the right direction,' said Bundeskanzler Christian Stocker (\u00d6VP). 'We are committed to making the government more efficient and effective.' The new government will consist of 21 members, including Bundeskanzler Christian Stocker (\u00d6VP), Staatssekret\u00e4r Pr\u00f6ll (\u00d6VP), and Minister Claudia Plakolm (\u00d6VP). The new division of the government includes the creation of a new Ministry for Women, Science, and Research, which will be headed by Minister Eva-Maria Holzleitner (SP\u00d6).

According to officials, the move comes amid frequent complaints about doctors and hospital staff being absent from duty at government hospitals. Health commissioner Amgothu Shri Ranga Nayak stated that all medical officers and staff must complete their online biometric registration by March 31, 2025. Dr Nagnath Yempalay, district civil surgeon, said that the move will help cut down morbidity and mortality amongst patients through the availability of timely treatment. However, an association of healthcare staff and doctors is opposing the move, arguing that it violates the Supreme Court's directives as the working hours exceed eight. They are demanding that more doctors be appointed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:40 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-to-make-biometric-attendance-mandatory-for-healthcare-staff-101741198567550.html)\n\n**Inside the 'slow-rolling catastrophe' of Trump's NOAA cuts**\nCuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will not only hinder the National Weather Service's ability to provide accurate day-to-day weather forecasts, but also impact efforts to protect endangered species, manage coastal regions, and prepare for climate change. The cuts, combined with the federal hiring freeze, have put NOAA on a 'break' trajectory, according to recently terminated staff. The move has sparked outrage from Democratic members of Congress and the public, with thousands protesting near NOAA campuses in Colorado and Maryland. As one source noted, 'Thousands of people showed up to protest on Monday near the Colorado and Maryland NOAA campuses in support of the National Weather Service, which has a higher favorability rating than Taylor Swift.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91291167/inside-the-slow-rolling-catastrophe-of-trumps-noaa-cuts)\n\n**California Ends Remote Work: All State Employees Must Return to Offices by July 1, 2025**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has signed an executive order requiring all state employees to return to their offices and work in person, starting from July 1, 2025. This decision aims to strengthen the state's response to emergencies and disasters, where California needs to be prepared to act quickly and effectively. According to Newsom, 'in-person work makes us stronger, period.' The new policy requires at least four days of in-person work per week, with exceptions for employees with special circumstances or needs. This change may be difficult for those who have grown accustomed to remote work, but it is intended to prioritize the collective well-being and prepare the state for critical situations such as wildfires, climate emergencies, and other natural disasters. The state will also focus on filling vacancies in critical areas such as wildfire suppression, extreme weather forecasting, and climate resilience.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:50 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/california-pone-fin-al-teletrabajo-todos-los-trabajadores-estatales-deberan-volver-a-las-oficinas-desde-esta-fecha-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**Severe Storm to Hit US, Testing NOAA's Reduced Staff**\nA severe storm is expected to intensify and potentially reach 'almost record-breaking force for March' as it moves east through the eastern part of the US on Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. This will be the first major test for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its National Weather Service, which has faced recent cuts under the Trump administration. 'The staffing adjustments will have perilous consequences for public safety,' scientists warn, as reported by CNN. The NOAA recently laid off around 800 employees as part of Trump's federal workforce reduction through the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/03/05/inusual-tormenta-para-marzo-en-eeuu/)\n\n**People may still boost state pension even after deadline passes in April**\nPeople who miss the April 5 deadline to boost their state pension may still be able to make payments after the cut-off date. To do this, they must complete a form requesting a call back by the April 5 deadline. The Government has introduced an online call back request form on the gov.uk website for those struggling to contact the Department for Work and Pensions by phone. A Government spokesperson said, 'Our new online tool will mean that savers will be able to make top-up payments after the April 5 deadline, provided they complete the call back request form ahead of that date.' Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister, added, 'For many people a state pension top-up will be excellent value. But it is useful to be able to discuss your options with someone who can see your NI record and in particular highlight if topping up some years would be of little or no value.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 03:10 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/people-may-still-boost-state-150817231.html)\n\n**Sarasota's Climate Adaptation Center founder: Too soon to judge impact of NOAA cuts**\nBob Bunting, CEO and chairman of the Sarasota-based Climate Adaptation Center, said it's too soon to judge the impact of NOAA's staff cuts on hurricane forecasting for the 2025 season and beyond. Bunting, who has inside knowledge of the agency, characterized NOAA as 'big science and big technology' with a sophisticated workforce. He noted that some aspects of NOAA could be privatized, but matters that impact life and property, such as hurricane forecasting, cannot be privatized. The Climate Adaptation Center will release its official forecast for the 2025 hurricane season on April 1, roughly six weeks before NOAA's Climate Prediction Center release, to give people more preparation time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/sarasotas-climate-adaptation-center-founder-090435937.html)\n\n**Mass Layoffs at NOAA Spark Concern Over Climate Science Future**\nHundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off at a key US agency, sparking concern in the scientific community. According to a California congressman, the massive personnel cuts will impact research and environmental policies. The layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are causing concern, as the agency is crucial for weather forecasting, climate analysis, and marine conservation, which are vital for responding to climate change and natural disasters. The NOAA has been criticized by conservative sectors, particularly since the launch of the 2025 Project, a plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which accuses the agency of being a 'main driver' of climate alarmism and proposes its dismantling. This attack on the NOAA has sparked a debate about the future of climate science in the US and raises serious doubts about the country's ability to face environmental challenges.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/usa/actualidad/usa-2025-cientos-de-despidos-en-agencia-climatica-de-estados-unidos-generan-preocupacion-sobre-su-futuro-rppusa-noticia-1619064)\n\n**NOAA Scientists Laid Off Amid Controversial 'Project 2025' Plan**\nHundreds of scientists and experts have been laid off at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a US federal agency responsible for weather forecasting, climate analysis, and marine conservation. The move, announced by Democratic Representative Jared Huffman, is seen as an attempt to dismantle government scientific institutions. The layoffs were overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, who is implementing the controversial 'Project 2025' plan developed by the Heritage Foundation. According to the project's promoters, NOAA is one of the 'main drivers of the climate alarmism industry', justifying the intention to downsize the agency and privatize the National Weather Service, handing it over to companies like AccuWeather. Huffman expressed concern about the consequences of this policy, stating that the removal of scientists and experts could put public safety at risk. Environmental associations have also reacted with harsh criticism. Miyoko Sakashita, director of the oceans program at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the operation 'a real sabotage', highlighting the danger to marine protection and safety programs. Meanwhile, the NOAA has avoided specific comments on the layoffs, limiting itself to ensuring the continuity of the service.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 04:51 AM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/02/noaa-allarmismo-climatico-licenziati-centinaia-scienziati/1001753233/)\n\n**Hundreds of Scientists and Experts Laid Off from NOAA Amid Government Efficiency Cuts**\nAccording to a Democratic congressman, hundreds of scientists and experts have been laid off from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a key US agency responsible for weather forecasting, climate analysis, and marine conservation.

The layoffs coincide with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, which is implementing radical workforce reductions that may exceed legal authority, according to critics. The NOAA has been targeted by conservative ideologues behind the 2025 Project, a government plan that seems to be following the new administration of President Trump. The plan, developed by the Heritage Foundation, describes NOAA as one of the 'main drivers of the climate change alarm industry' and calls for the agency's dismantling. Huffman stated, 'The purge of government scientists, experts, and career officials and the cutting of fundamental programs will cost lives.' Environmental defenders echoed these concerns.

'The new Trump administration poses a grave threat to climate, energy, and justice priorities,' said Juan Declet-Barreto, a scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The NOAA is responsible for providing critical weather forecasts, monitoring solar activity, and managing fisheries. The agency's employees, including those who work on the National Weather Service, are being laid off, and funding is being frozen. 'This is a disaster for the country and the climate,' said Declet-Barreto. The NOAA's work is essential for predicting extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. The agency's data is also crucial for the fishing industry and for understanding the impact of climate change on the environment. 'We need champions like the NOAA to face climate change,' said Declet-Barreto. 'Their research, policies, and environmental protections are essential for a sustainable and just future.' The Trump administration has already removed climate change information from government websites and is planning to dismantle the NOAA. Scientists are resisting by downloading and saving data, recreating tools, and sharing captures of archived screens. They are calling on all scientists to contribute to this effort.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[Futura](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/savoirs-tempete-solaire-devastatrice-pourrait-foncer-nous-on-sabote-seule-agence-pourrait-nous-proteger-119933/)\n\n**NOAA Scientists Ordered to Obtain Prior Approval for International Communications**\nScientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been ordered to obtain prior approval before speaking with their Canadian counterparts. This includes participating in international meetings or even joining phone calls with Canadian colleagues. According to Aaron Fisk, a Canadian ecologist, this new directive has made it impossible for some government scientists to have meetings with their American colleagues. Fisk wanted to organize a virtual meeting to discuss projects with American colleagues, including a government scientist, about sampling fish in the Great Lakes. The NOAA provides scientific information, research, and forecasts, including daily weather reports, hurricane tracking, climate modeling, and marine surveillance. In response to the situation, NOAA spokesperson Rachel Hager denied that scientists have been ordered to stop communicating with international colleagues. However, internal emails reveal the opposite. The Canadian government claims to have received no official notice of changes in its collaboration with the NOAA. Despite this, internal emails show that employees of the NOAA have been asked to obtain approval from senior management for all future international engagements until March 2025. The new directives indicate that limits on international engagements should be applied broadly, including all international travel funded by the NOAA, travel to the US for international meetings, and all virtual meetings on international scientific topics. Even virtual meetings must be reviewed if they involve sensitive topics such as climate change. Emails with international colleagues that are of a scientific nature and involve the exchange of scientific data must also be validated. Despite the situation, scientists are encouraged to continue their work. Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, believes that science is under attack in the US and encourages her colleagues to stay hopeful. 'I think we should face it and act on a daily basis,' she says. The threat of massive layoffs at the NOAA has also discouraged many federal scientists. According to Andrew Rosenberg, former deputy director of the National Marine Fisheries Service at the NOAA, a 50% reduction in staff is being discussed in Washington.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 10:11 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/fr/nouvelle/2141751/acces-communications-scientifiques-americains-canadiens)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a Brings a Colder Winter: How to Prepare and Choose the Best Heating System**\nThe NOAA's Climate Prediction Center has confirmed the arrival of La Ni\u00f1a, a phenomenon that will persist until April 2025 with a 59% probability, and will then give way to a neutral phase between March and May. This event is characterized by the cooling of the equatorial Pacific, altering global climate patterns. In Chile, it usually causes colder winters and less rainfall, especially in the central region. Experts warn that the 2025 winter could register lower temperatures than usual, although the impact will depend on the duration and intensity of the phenomenon. However, the decrease in precipitation will exacerbate the drought affecting the country, while the cold could generate frosts that will harm the population. To prepare for a potentially colder winter, it is essential to choose the right heating system. Options such as pellet stoves, gas stoves, and traditional combustion stoves are available, each with its own characteristics. When selecting a heating system, it is crucial to consider factors such as space, type of fuel, and efficiency of the equipment, as well as aspects such as safety and maintenance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 11:46 PM\nSource:[tiempo21.cl](https://www.tiempo21.cl/fenomeno-de-la-nina-traera-un-invierno-mas-frio-como-prepararse-y-elegir-la-mejor-calefaccion/)\n\n**Trump Team Looks to Drastically Cut Weather and Climate Agency**\nThe Trump administration is planning to drastically cut the workforce of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with a proposal to halve the number of employees from 12,000 to 6,000. This would cripple an agency that provides climate and weather information across the U.S. economy, said Craig McLean, a former assistant administrator of NOAA Research. 'The goal is to just crush [it] with a hammer, hard blows, and shrink that federal workforce,' McLean said. The cuts would also reduce NOAA's budget by 30 percent. McLean warned that mass cuts at the agency would have a ripple effect across the U.S. economy, as NOAA's products benefit various industries, including finance, real estate, and agriculture. The proposal is part of the Project 2025 conservative policy proposal, which calls for NOAA to be 'broken up and downsized' largely because of its climate change research. NOAA officials have been communicating the changes verbally to avoid putting it in a written memo or email that can be leaked. However, the officials cautioned that the proposal could be an intimidation tactic to pressure employees to take up the administration's offer to resign early.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-team-looks-to-drastically-cut-noaa-staff-and-budget/)\n\n**Trump's Administration Blocks Climate Data, Raises Concerns About Noaa's Future**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) was temporarily blocked from displaying its CO2 monitoring page for 24 hours after a group of officials from the Department of Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, accessed the agency's system. The move has raised concerns that sensitive climate change data may have been removed, which could hinder public access to crucial climate measurements. This comes after President Donald Trump removed climate change references from other federal agency websites. The new head of Noaa, Neil Jacobs, has a history of promoting antiscientific behavior, including altering a hurricane map to support Trump's claims. Jacobs has also been criticized for his role in the agency's handling of the 2019 hurricane season. Meanwhile, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Epa), Lee Zeldin, has a history of voting against environmental regulations and has ties to the fossil fuel industry. The actions of the Trump administration seem to align with the Project 2025 manifesto, which calls for the Noaa to be 'smashed and reduced' and is seen as a threat to the agency's ability to provide accurate climate information.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[open.online](https://www.open.online/2025/02/07/trump-musk-cambiamento-climatico-noaa-sparisce-co2-dati-pubblici-privati/)\n\n**El Ni\u00f1o Phenomenon Expected to Continue Until April 2025**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has officially announced the development of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, which is expected to continue until April 2025 with a 60% probability. El Ni\u00f1o is linked statistically to the intensification of the Siberian high-pressure system over the Mediterranean during winter, and its effects are evident in the region, particularly in the Middle East, where there is a decrease in rainfall, while the opposite is true in North Africa, where there is an increase in rainfall and a decrease in temperature. The phenomenon is also associated with an increased risk of flooding and landslides in North Africa and a higher risk of drought in the Middle East. According to computer modeling, the region will continue to experience abundant rainfall in the coming months. NOAA has classified this El Ni\u00f1o as weak, but its effects have been evident in the past few months. El Ni\u00f1o affects global weather patterns in multiple ways, leading to changes in temperature and precipitation in various parts of the world. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty the impact of El Ni\u00f1o on the global climate, as it is part of a larger pattern of global weather systems.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[arabiaweather.com](https://www.arabiaweather.com/ar/content/%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%AC%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%8B%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%83%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B6%D8%B9%D9%81-%D8%A3%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a Officially Declared by NOAA, but Scientists Disagree**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has officially declared the arrival of La Ni\u00f1a, a weather phenomenon that occurs when the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean cools down. The declaration was made on January 9, 2025, after a period of 1.5 months of anomalies in the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, which is a key indicator of La Ni\u00f1a. The SST anomaly in this region reached -0.6\u00b0C in December, and has persisted in January. According to the NOAA, there is a 59% chance that La Ni\u00f1a will persist through February-April 2025, followed by a 60% chance of neutral conditions in March-May 2025. However, some scientists disagree with the declaration, citing a lack of persistence and changing predictions from models. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has declared neutral conditions, while the NOAA has emphasized that the declaration is based on a combination of oceanic and atmospheric indicators, including the SST anomaly, wind patterns, and precipitation. The declaration of La Ni\u00f1a has sparked debate among scientists about the role of climate change in the phenomenon and the ability of models to accurately predict it.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[tiempo.com](https://www.tiempo.com/noticias/actualidad/la-nina-mas-tardia-de-la-historia-divide-a-los-cientificos-sobre-su-confirmacion-una-meteorologa-de-brasil-lo-explica.html)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a Declared by NOAA, but Debate Remains**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared that 'La Ni\u00f1a is among us', with a 59% chance of persisting until February-April 2025. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center has analyzed the latest data and found that the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is in its cold phase, known as La Ni\u00f1a. The ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere system that lasts for several months, and its changes affect global atmospheric conditions, modifying temperature and precipitation patterns. The NOAA's analysis shows that the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean has cooled, with the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index dropping to -0.6\u00b0C in December, indicating a La Ni\u00f1a event. However, some scientists argue that the ENSO is still in a neutral phase, and that La Ni\u00f1a may not persist for the next few months. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicts that La Ni\u00f1a will be weak and short-lived, with a 60% chance of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions in March-May 2025. The probability of La Ni\u00f1a persisting until March-May 2025 is around 40%. The NOAA emphasizes that the ENSO is a complex system, and that predicting its behavior is challenging. 'The wait is over and La Ni\u00f1a is officially here,' said the NOAA, 'but the debate is open.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[meteored.com.ar](https://www.meteored.com.ar/noticias/actualidad/noaa-afirma-la-nina-esta-entre-nosotros-debil-corta-duracion-oceano-mar-temperatura-pacifico-lluvia-sequia-argentina-debate.html)\n\n**Government's 'Clean Air' Program to Resume in 2025 with Reforms**\nThe government's 'Clean Air' program will be reinstated on April 1, 2025, according to Minister of Climate and Environment Paulina Hennig-Kloska. She stated that after consulting with the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, she set a deadline for the program's return. Changes will be made, focusing on the way controls and subsidies are administered. The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management suspended new applications to the program in late November, citing the need for reform and system tightening. In December, the Fund reported that it had filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office regarding several companies suspected of committing crimes under the program, with disputed contracts totaling approximately 600 million z\u0142.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[www.money.pl](https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/oto-termin-powrotu-rzadowego-programu-beda-kontrole-wkroczy-skarbowka-7112709778238176a.html)\n\n**NOAA Declares the Official Return of La Ni\u00f1a as Storms hit North America to Start 2025**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared the return of La Ni\u00f1a, a period of global cooling that is expected to bring warm and dry winter conditions to the southern United States and wet and snowy conditions to the Pacific Northwest and northern Plains. However, cold and snow in the East is less likely during La Ni\u00f1a. According to NOAA, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are present and are expected to persist through February-April 2025 (59% chance), with a transition to ENSO-neutral likely during March-May 2025 (60% chance). NOAA's National Weather Service and funded institutions predict weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions through the early spring before transitioning to ENSO-neutral. As NOAA's Climate Prediction Center Director said, 'This is a critical period for monitoring and predicting the trajectory of world temperatures.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[freeskier.com](https://freeskier.com/the-wire/la-nina-is-here)\n\n",

However, after reviewing news articles in Phase 2, experts revised their probabilities downward slightly (ranging from 75% to 95%), citing concerns over significant layoffs and restructuring at NOAA under political pressures, particularly from the Trump administration's 'Project 2025'. Despite these challenges, experts still believe the website is likely to remain online due to its critical importance and public advocacy.",
