According to Tishkovets, 'This will be the final day of the March cold, and from Thursday, the temperature will start to rise.' The weather will be influenced by a warm atmospheric front, resulting in a multilayered cloud cover and light precipitation in the form of a mix of rain and snow. The wind will be southwest to west at 4-9 m/s, with gusts. The temperature in Moscow will range from +1 to +4 degrees Celsius, while in the surrounding area, it will be from 0 to +5 degrees Celsius. By the weekend, the temperature will reach April-like levels, ranging from +7 to +10 degrees Celsius. However, a new wave of winter is expected to arrive in the city at the end of March and beginning of April, as reported by synoptic forecaster Alexander Ilyin. Meanwhile, Scientific Director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center Roman Vilfand advises drivers not to change their winter tires to summer tires at least for the next five days, as the roads are icy and there will be light precipitation in the form of wet snow in the coming week.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:06 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430](https://vm.ru/news/1214609-sinoptik-tishkovec-sreda-v-moskve-stanet-poslednim-dnem-martovskogo-holoda)\n\n**Yucat\u00e1n Faces Drought and Heat in April, Authorities Warn of Fire Risk**\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is currently free of drought, but the upcoming month of April is expected to be the driest in 2025. According to the National Meteorological Service, a drought is confirmed when there is a prolonged lack of rain, which affects crops and livestock. 'If it starts to rain below the average, it starts to create a deficit of rain. But that's not yet a drought', said an expert. The region with the highest risk of extreme heat and fires is the western and southern part of the state, including M\u00e9rida, Motul, Izamal, Hunucm\u00e1, Ticul, Oxkutzcab, Tekax, and Peto. The authorities have a plan in place to deal with the situation and urge the community to report any signs of fires. 'If we are at 43, 44 degrees, with wind and it's dry, it's perfect for a fire to form', warned the expert. The main recommendation is to be aware of weather alerts and report any signs of fires. 'Patience, because the rains always come', they added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:56 AM\nSource:[El Diario de Yucat\u00e1n](http://www.yucatan.com.mx/merida/2025/03/18/sequia-en-yucatan-este-seria-el-mes-mas-seco-en-2025.html)\n\n**Se anticipa el regreso de las tormentas en el AMBA y hay malas noticias para el fin de semana largo**\nThe National Meteorological Service and forecasters like Meteored have provided details on the upcoming weather in the AMBA region.

The alfombra, which will be over 3.5 kilometers long and 2 meters wide, will be created by over 3,000 people, including residents, families, and artists. The event will take place on April 18, 2025, and will be a testament to the city's rich cultural heritage. According to the Municipalidad de Guatemala, the alfombra will be created with the help of a special task force, which will ensure the order, security, and well-being of the participants. The city has also prepared a special agenda for the Easter celebrations, which will include cultural activities, concerts, and exhibitions. Additionally, the city has implemented a special protocol for emergency situations, which will be activated from April 12 to 20. The protocol will include the deployment of police, firefighters, and medical personnel to ensure the safety of the participants and spectators.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/vida/de-3-5-kilometros-de-devocion-la-alfombra-mas-extensa-de-guatemala-engalanara-el-viernes-santo-2025/)\n\n**Possible First Summer Day of 2025: Temperatures to Reach Up to 25 Degrees Celsius**\nA meteorologist, Dominik Jung, predicts that it could be the first summer day of the year 2025 on Friday, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celsius. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), a summer day is defined as a day with a minimum air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Jung says that it will be unusually warm for the season, with temperatures in the west and southwest reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius, and locally even warmer. In the east, temperatures will reach up to 21 degrees Celsius, and in the north, up to 18 degrees Celsius. Jung also notes that the sun will shine brightly throughout the country, with 10-12 hours of sunshine per day. However, a high-pressure system called 'Konstantina' will bring Saharan dust to the country, which may cloud the sky in the west on Friday. Despite this, temperatures are expected to remain warm over the weekend, with values of 15-22 degrees Celsius predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Jung notes that it is still unclear how the weather will develop in April and May, and that cold air masses may still occur.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[T-online.de](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/wetter/id_100641434/wetter-bis-zu-25-grad-diese-woche-erster-sommertag-moeglich.html)\n\n**Senamhi: Provinces and Regions in the Sierra to Continue Suffering High Temperatures**\nThe National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (Senamhi) has announced that high temperatures will continue in the Sierra region until Thursday, March 20, with expected values ranging from 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C in the northern Sierra, 20\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C in the central Sierra, and 18\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C in the southern Sierra.

The heat index could reach 40\u00b0C due to low wind speeds, ranging from 15 to 20 km/h. According to Manuel Prado, climate expert at the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), 'temperatures will range from 22 to 24\u00b0C in the west and Pacific, while in the northern highlands, such as Jinotega and Matagalpa, they will oscillate between 18 and 20\u00b0C.' The authorities recommend avoiding prolonged exposure to the sun, wearing light-colored clothing, and staying hydrated. Prado added, 'we will feel drier skin and more heat, so it's essential to stay hydrated and wear light, light-colored clothing to mitigate the heat effect.' People with chronic diseases are advised to take necessary precautions to avoid further suffering. This heat wave is expected to persist in the coming weeks, with temperatures increasing as April approaches, the hottest month of the year in Nicaragua.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 05:08 PM\nSource:[TN8.tv](https://www.tn8.tv/nacionales/nicaragua-vivira-una-semana-de-intenso-calor-temperaturas-de-hasta-40-grados/)\n\n**Guatemala Suspends Classes Due to Poor Air Quality**\nGuatemala has suspended classes in two departments due to poor air quality. According to a statement from the Ministry of Education, the decision was made in response to a fire at the Amatitl\u00e1n Waste Management Authority (AMSA) landfill and recommendations from the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (Conred). The affected areas include the municipality of Guatemala City and surrounding areas San Miguel Petapa, Amatitl\u00e1n, Villa Canales, and Villa Nueva. The National Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology reported that the air quality is 'very bad', posing a risk to human health. Conred stated that they are continuing to coordinate efforts to control and extinguish the fire at the AMSA landfill. This is not the first time classes have been suspended due to air quality issues, as a similar incident occurred in April 2024 in the same department and Sacatep\u00e9quez.

The regions expected to be the hottest are the Pacific, Bocacosta, and Valles de Oriente, where maximum temperatures are expected to range from 30 to 38 degrees Celsius. Zacapa is expected to reach temperatures of 34 to 36 degrees Celsius, with a possibility of reaching 38 degrees. The Insivumeh recommends that institutions take the information into account for planning and execution of activities, and that the population take precautions to avoid heat-related complications. The Insivumeh also warns of the risk of forest fires due to low humidity and high temperatures in certain regions. 'It is essential to take preventive measures to protect the population and prevent potential disasters,' said the Insivumeh. 'We recommend that people stay hydrated and protect themselves from the sun, especially between 11am and 4pm, when temperatures are usually at their highest and UV rays are stronger.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 10:37 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/comunitario/marzo-caluroso-el-termometro-superara-los-36-grados-en-varias-regiones-de-guatemala/)\n\n**Guatemala to Experience Hot Weekend with Temperatures Reaching 40\u00b0C**\nThe National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh) predicts a very hot weekend in Guatemala on March 8-9, 2025, with temperatures potentially reaching 40\u00b0C. The Insivumeh recommends taking precautions to protect oneself from the sun and heat, such as staying hydrated, using sunscreen, and avoiding exposure to direct sunlight during the hottest hours. The agency also advises consuming light and fresh foods, and being aware of the symptoms of heatstroke, which include dizziness, excessive sweating, red skin, headaches, and weakness. By following these tips, people can enjoy the activities of Lent and Holy Week without putting their health at risk. 'Hidrataci\u00f3n constante' is key, says the Insivumeh, 'Bebe suficiente agua durante el d\u00eda, incluso si no sientes sed.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[guatemala.com](https://www.guatemala.com/noticias/comunidad/clima-en-guatemala-del-8-y-9-de-marzo-de-2025.html)\n\n**Guatemala to Experience Rise in Temperatures, but Not as Extreme as 2024**\nAccording to the Instituto Nacional de Sismolog\u00eda, Vulcanolog\u00eda, Meteorolog\u00eda e Hidrolog\u00eda (Insivumeh), Guatemala will experience a rise in temperatures, but not as extreme as in 2024 due to the effects of the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. C\u00e9sar George, a meteorologist at Insivumeh, stated that the predictions were based on studies conducted in 2024. 'These forecasts were based on the temperature anomalies presented by the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico last year. The temperatures are not as high and have started to decrease,' he explained. Despite this prediction, George noted that it is normal for temperatures to reach between 40 and 42 degrees Celsius in March and April, mainly in Pet\u00e9n and the eastern part of the country. The expert also mentioned that the first region to experience rain is expected to be the Boca Costa and Suroccidente, where some rain is predicted to occur from April 10 to 20. The Instituto Privado de Cambio Clim\u00e1tico warns that the temperature will continue to rise globally, and in Guatemala, the rainfall will decrease by 30% in the next few years, leading to more droughts, forest fires, water scarcity, and a decrease in the water level of wells. The experts also note that the extreme heat with intervals of rain will increase the spread of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya due to the proliferation of virus-carrying insects. Although the temperatures will not be extreme, scientists, doctors, and farmers warn that the hot environment reduces grain production and the smoke from forest fires generates poor air quality that affects people with respiratory diseases. Additionally, there is an increase in allergies, asthma, and lung diseases due to the presence of smoke and dust. People working outdoors, such as construction workers, vendors, and farmers, may suffer from dehydration and heat strokes. Alex Guerra, director of the Instituto Privado de Cambio Clim\u00e1tico, stated, 'The consequences increase every year, but this year we have good news, because at least we won't have temperatures as critical as last year.' He added, 'El Ni\u00f1o will bring drought and a lot of heat, and we've been seeing this since June 2023, but at the end of 2024, the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon entered, and there will be heat, but not at the same levels as last year.' Guerra emphasizes that despite the effects of La Ni\u00f1a, there are more vulnerable departments to drought in the dry corridor in Chiquimula. 'Last year, there were even fires in forests where they didn't occur before, such as in the Quetzal biotope, in Semuc Champey, and in the cloud forest of the Agua volcano. We will be under the influence of the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon for the next six months and then enter a neutral phase,' he explained. For the expert, Guatemala should work on plans to mitigate the consequences of high temperatures. 'Studies in Guatemala have determined that in the next few years, the rain will decrease by 10% and in a more pessimistic scenario, it could decrease by 30%. This, of course, translates to more droughts, damage to agriculture, less water in the lagoons,' he emphasized.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:34 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/comunitario/calor-excesivo-insivumeh-aclara-si-habra-temperaturas-extremas-como-ocurrio-en-el-2024/)\n\n**Dry and Warm Air Mass to Cover Guatemala This Week**\nA dry and warm air mass will cover Guatemala this week, causing temperatures to rise. According to the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh), temperatures in various areas of the country are expected to be high from March 3 to 7. Pet\u00e9n and Escuintla will be the most affected regions, with maximum temperatures reaching up to 37 degrees Celsius. In the capital city, temperatures are expected to reach up to 29 degrees Celsius. The Insivumeh bulletin also mentions that the first hours of the morning will be covered by fog or haze, while the sky will be partially cloudy during the day. The 'Clima Guatemala' website also reports that a dry and warm air mass will dominate the country in the coming days. The weather will be warm and hazy during the day, with temperatures in the city ranging from 27 to 29 degrees Celsius. In the highlands of the Central and Western regions, maximum temperatures will range from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius, with minimum temperatures dropping between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius in the early morning. In the Pacific regions, a warm and sunny weather is expected, with some scattered showers possible in the areas of Boca Costa and Suroccidente from Wednesday, March 5. Temperatures in this region are expected to reach up to 35-37 degrees Celsius.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 06:23 PM\nSource:[Soy502](https://www.soy502.com/articulo/masa-aire-seco-cubrira-guatemala-esta-semana-101477)\n\n**Guatemala Prepares for Summer Heat**\nAs the summer approaches, Guatemalans are preparing for the high temperatures. According to C\u00e9sar George, a meteorologist from the Instituto Nacional de Sismolog\u00eda, Vulcanolog\u00eda, Meteorolog\u00eda e Hidrolog\u00eda (Insivumeh), the temperatures this year are expected to be lower than those in 2023/2024, which were elevated due to an anomaly in the Atlantic and Caribbean. The anomaly, which consisted of an increase of 1.4 and 1.6 degrees in the ocean, has started to decrease, and is now between 0.8 and 0.7 degrees, anticipating that there will not be extreme temperatures. Additionally, there have been rain showers in the north of the country, which, according to George, favors a lower incidence of forest fires that occur during the dry season. The Insivumeh predicts that in the eastern region and some areas of Pet\u00e9n, the intensity of heat could reach between 40 and 42 degrees, and in the capital, the maximum temperatures will oscillate between 30 and 32 degrees. Juan Laureano, spokesperson for the Coordinadora Nacional para la Reducci\u00f3n de Desastres (Conred), warns that emergencies do not announce themselves, and the climate condition, although there are forecasts, can be unpredictable. The authorities recommend taking precautions when handling fires and agricultural burns, and to report any forest fires to the authorities. Patricia May\u00e9n, head of Pediatric Dermatology at the Hospital General San Juan de Dios and ClinderAler, recommends applying sunscreen with a factor of 50+ to all people, including children, to protect against the high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV) that can cause skin damage and even cancer. The experts suggest various ways to stay cool, such as using fans, air conditioners, and plants to purify the air, as well as taking precautions to protect pets and children from the heat. 'It is essential to be aware and report any emergencies to avoid serious damage, such as the loss of forest areas and fauna,' says May\u00e9n. 'The ideal is to avoid exposing ourselves to the sun from 10 am to 3 or 4 pm, according to the experts. Additionally, it is essential to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and to use sunglasses to protect our eyes.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 09:07 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/comunitario/llega-la-temporada-de-verano-y-con-ella-altas-temperaturas-con-las-que-debemos-convivir/)\n\n**Insivumeh Forecasts High Solar Radiation in Guatemala**\nAccording to the Guatemalan National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh), high solar radiation is expected in Guatemala on Saturday, March 1, 2025. The Insivumeh department of forecasting reported that the weather will be 'warm and sunny, with few clouds in the morning and partial clouds in the afternoon.' However, a slight influx of humidity from the Caribbean Sea may cause local rain showers in the Northern Transversal Strip and the Caribbean region of the country. Despite the high solar radiation, the Insivumeh warned that low temperatures are expected in the evening, especially at night and in the early morning. The Insivumeh advised Guatemalans to dress warmly at night to prevent respiratory diseases. The lowest temperatures in the past few hours were recorded in Quetzaltenango (4.2\u00b0C), Huehuetenango (7.4\u00b0C), and Alta Verapaz (11\u00b0C).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[Emisoras Unidas 89.7FM](https://emisorasunidas.com/nacional/2025/03/01/insivumeh-pronostica-alta-radiacion-solar-en-proximas-horas/)\n\n**Guatemala Welcomes the Warm Season**\nThe Guatemalan people are saying goodbye to the cold season and welcoming the warm season, which is expected to start in March, according to the National Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh).

This is not just a number, but a warning about the risks of climate change and its consequences for the planet. The last ten years were the warmest on record, and the increase in temperatures in 2023 and 2024 was so abrupt that it exceeded the scientists' predictions. The increase is due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, including the accumulation of greenhouse gases due to human activities, the reduction of sulfur aerosols emitted by maritime transport, which previously acted as reflectors of solar radiation, and the influence of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which reached its peak at the end of 2023. The interaction of these factors causes the rise in global average temperature, which reached 1.62\u00b0C \u00b1 0.06\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average (1850-1900). This is the second consecutive year in which the critical threshold of 1.5\u00b0C has been exceeded, a worrying signal that reinforces the need to act urgently on climate change. In 2024, 24% of the land surface recorded record temperatures that affected 3.3 billion people. Countries such as Brazil, China, Mexico, and Central American nations experienced an exceptionally warm year, with annual averages of +1.4\u00b0C in Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama; and +1.5\u00b0C in Guatemala and Nicaragua. Even in the oceans, which absorb a large part of the planet's heat, temperatures reached +1.15\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The warming has devastating effects: prolonged heatwaves, forest fires, crop decline, and sea level rise, which threatens coastal communities. Marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, are also severely affected by the massive bleaching caused by the rise in ocean temperature. The goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels has been a central point of international attention, enshrined as a global goal in the Paris Agreement. The limit was established taking into account multi-decadal averages, so a single year that exceeds that threshold does not automatically represent a failure. However, the rate of greenhouse gas emissions indicates that this goal could be exceeded in the next five or ten years. This does not mean that the fight is lost; however, each additional fraction of a degree of warming implies more severe and costly impacts. During the last decades, warming has been almost linear, with an increase of 0.20\u00b0C per decade due to the constant increase in greenhouse gases. In 2024, a record was set in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The annual amount emitted was 0.8% higher than in 2023, setting a new historical maximum. In light of this, it is crucial to strengthen measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the most urgent actions are the transition to renewable energy sources and the progressive abandonment of fossil fuels, which in Costa Rica implies transforming mobility through an efficient and accessible public transportation system that reduces the use of personal vehicles; the reduction of deforestation and the restoration of critical ecosystems such as mangroves, forests, and wetlands; and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices and diets with lower carbon footprints. In addition to mitigating, it is essential to strengthen the capacity of adaptation of the most vulnerable communities. This includes investing in resilient infrastructure, improving early warning systems, and ensuring both water and food security in the face of extreme climate events. The data from 2024 are a wake-up call. Although the future presents great challenges, there is still room to avoid the worst scenarios. Science is clear and precise: every action counts, and every fraction of a degree avoided makes a difference for millions of people and the planet's biodiversity. It is time to move from commitments to actions. The next years will be crucial in determining whether we will be able to reverse this trend or if we will leave a legacy of inaction that will mark the destiny of future generations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 03:07 AM\nSource:[La Naci\u00f3n, Grupo Naci\u00f3n](https://www.nacion.com/opinion/columnistas/el-calor-rompe-records-y-debemos-preguntarnos-si/DAM2LEI7EBB5NMCGMEDNKEC2TA/story/)\n\n",

Initially, the experts estimated low probabilities for such an event, citing factors like the city's typical climate patterns and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. These probabilities ranged from 0% to 45%, with most experts leaning towards a 0% to 15% range. Following phase 2, which involved updates from news articles reporting on ongoing and expected extreme heat in Guatemala, many experts revised their probabilities downwards or maintained low probabilities, reinforcing their initial assessments. The revised probabilities mostly fell between 0% and 20%, with the majority of experts agreeing that sustained high temperatures make it unlikely for the temperature to stay below 80\u00b0F during the forecast period.",
