This measure will prohibit the entry of individuals with a specific type of visa, specifically the EB-4 visa, which is intended for certain religious workers. According to USCIS, new applications and status adjustments for this type of visa will not be processed, leaving affected migrants without the possibility of entering the country under these terms. The restriction will primarily affect non-minister religious workers who were hoping to regularize their situation in the US through this visa category. USCIS has stated that the suspension is due to a change in immigration policies that aims to prioritize other types of visas. As stated by USCIS, 'This change affects primarily non-minister religious workers who may have used the EB-4 visa to regularize their status in the US. The suspension does not include ministers or their families, who remain eligible for this visa without additional restrictions.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2025/03/11/uscis-confirma-inmigrantes-con-este-tipo-de-visa-no-podran-ingresar-a-estados-unidos-desde-el-14-de-marzo-lrtmus-164120)\n\n**DHS Releases Interim Final Rule on Alien Registration Requirement**\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released an Interim Final Rule (IFR) on March 7, 2025, implementing the Alien Registration Requirement announced in February. The rule requires three categories of noncitizens to register through a myUSCIS online account within specific timeframes. Noncitizens who possess certain forms, such as those issued by a federal agency or filed for a specific immigration benefit, are already registered. However, noncitizens who turn age 14 must re-register and be fingerprinted within 30 days of their 14th birthdays. The registration method for children varies by status, and biometrics will be waived for Canadian business and tourist visitors who enter by land. Registering will be free initially, but USCIS has solicited public comment on a $30 fee that may be implemented in the future. All noncitizens age 18 or over are legally required to carry registration evidence or face misdemeanor prosecution, fines, and/or jail time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 07:52 PM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/dhs-releases-interim-final-rule-alien-registration-requirement)\n\n**USCIS Rejects Green Card Applications Without Latest Form**\nSince February 2025, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has been rejecting Green Card applications from foreign citizens who do not meet a new requirement. This measure has caused concern among migrants seeking to regularize their situation in the country. The USCIS now requires that all Green Card applications be submitted using the latest version of the I-485 form, which was updated on October 24, 2024. Any application submitted with an outdated version will be automatically rejected, even if it was sent before February 10, 2025. This change aims to standardize the use of the updated form and improve migration processes. However, it may pose a challenge for Mexicans who are not aware of this modification, as using an outdated form could cause delays in their processing during 2025. 'The adjustment of status to obtain the Green Card is a crucial process for citizens of other countries who want to obtain permanent residence in the United States, allowing them to live and work indefinitely in the country,' said USCIS. However, this process is subject to a series of strict requirements.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 06:02 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2025/03/11/green-card-2025-ee-uu-podria-negarles-la-tarjeta-verde-a-extranjeros-que-no-cumplan-con-este-importante-requisito-lrtmus-333894)\n\n**USCIS Announces H-1B Visa Registration Period**\nThe US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that the registration period for the H-1B visa will be open from March 7 to March 24. This visa allows US companies to hire foreign workers with specialized knowledge in technical and professional occupations. According to USCIS, 'if the number of requests exceeds the limit before March 24, beneficiaries will be selected randomly, and the results will be announced before March 31, 2025.' To facilitate the process, USCIS has implemented new features, including the ability for lawyers to collaborate on registrations and the option to pre-load information on the I-129 form. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that permits US companies to temporarily hire qualified foreign workers in specialized occupations that require highly specialized theoretical or technical knowledge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/estados-unidos/como-puedo-conseguir-visa-trabajo-para-ee-uu-abren-inscripcion-requisitos-PP4371153)\n\n**US Visa Bulletin Updates: Bad News for Indian Green Card Applicants**\nThe US Visa Bulletin for April 2025 has been released, which is bad news for Indian Green Card applicants. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has stated that the EB-5 visa category for Indian Green Card applicants has been 'retrogressed' by over two years, with the current date being November 1, 2019. The main reason for this is the increasing demand and delay in visa usage. This has affected people from India and China. The EB-5 visa is given to those who want to obtain a Green Card through investment. President Donald Trump wants to abolish this visa and replace it with a 'Gold Card' that will be given to investors who invest $5 million in the US. However, no timeline has been given for the introduction of the Gold Card. The Visa Bulletin has also brought some important updates. The Final Action Date for EB-1 category has been advanced to February 15, 2022 for India, while it remains November 8, 2022 for China. The Final Action Date for EB-2 category has been advanced to January 1, 2013 for India, October 1, 2020 for China, and June 22, 2023 for other countries. The Final Action Date for EB-3 category has been advanced to April 1, 2013 for India, November 1, 2020 for China, and January 1, 2023 for other countries. The EB-4 category is for special immigrants, including those who come to the US for religious work. The Final Action Date for EB-5 category has been retrogressed to November 1, 2019 for India and January 22, 2014 for China. The Visa Bulletin is a crucial document for those who want to obtain a Green Card. It provides a timeline for when applicants can file their applications. The two main sections of the Visa Bulletin are 'Dates for Filing' and 'Final Action Dates'. 'Dates for Filing' indicates when applicants can file their applications, while 'Final Action Dates' indicates when applicants will receive their Green Cards.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 12:52 PM\nSource:[Navbharat Times](https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/us/us-visa-bulletin-april-2025-updates-eb5-green-card-wait-for-indians-increase-by-2-years/articleshow/118887663.cms)\n\n**US Visa Bulletin: EB-5 Category Sees Significant Decline for India and China**\nThe US Department of State has released the April 2025 visa bulletin, which includes updates on employment-based immigrant visa categories. The EB-5 category has seen a significant decline for India and China, with India's cutoff date moving back to November 1, 2019, and China's cutoff date moving back to January 22, 2014. The EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories have seen some progress for India, while the EB-4 category will be unavailable for all countries until October 1, 2025, as the annual quota has been met. The USCIS will accept adjustment of status applications based on the final action dates chart in the visa bulletin. This allows applicants to file if their priority date is earlier than the cutoff date for their category and country. The decline in EB-5 for India and China is due to increased demand and usage of available visas. If demand continues to rise, a final action date may be set for all EB-5 applicants worldwide. The visa bulletin also includes final action dates for family-sponsored green cards, which have changed for various categories. The dates for filing family-sponsored green card applications have also been updated. The employment-based green card categories have seen some progress, with the EB-1 category moving forward slightly. The EB-5 category remains unavailable for most countries, with a cutoff date of November 1, 2019.

Indian and Chinese applicants in the EB-5 Unreserved category will experience a sharp retrogression of over two years, moving the Final Action Date back to November 1, 2019 and January 22, 2014 respectively. This is due to high demand and increased visa usage. Meanwhile, other countries remain current in this category. The retrogression will result in longer wait times for applicants with priority dates after the new Final Action Dates, investment uncertainty, and shifting preferences among applicants. The State Department has explained that the sharp retrogression is due to high demand and increased visa usage, and warns that if demand continues to rise, more countries may see a Final Action Date set for EB-5 Unreserved, affecting global investors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/indian-eb-5-applicants-hit-with-over-two-year-retrogression-green-card-wait-times-increase-us-visa-bulletin-for-april-2025/articleshow/118879819.cms)\n\n**US Visa Bulletin for April 2025: Green Card backlogs deepen; India faces over two-year EB-5 retrogression**\nThe US Department of State has released the April 2025 Visa Bulletin, which shows significant retrogression in the EB-5 Unreserved category for India and China.

This news has caused uncertainty among various communities and organizations that rely on this program. According to Infobae, 'As of midnight on March 13, no new visas will be issued under this category, nor will status adjustments be completed for applicants in process.' The EB-4 visa, also known as the 'special immigrants' visa, is directed at different groups of people, including young people in special situations, religious workers, international organization officials, and US military personnel. However, the expiration will only affect the subcategory of non-minister religious workers and their spouses and children, as established by the HR 10545 law signed on December 21, 2024. Infobae explains that 'After March 13, 2025, no new SR visas will be issued, nor will status adjustments be allowed under this category. Even visas granted before the expiration date will only be valid until the same day.' The USCIS has allowed expedited processing of EB-4 visa applications for religious workers, but this process does not guarantee automatic approval.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 10:12 AM\nSource:[EL UNIVERSO](https://www.eluniverso.com/estados-unidos/programa-de-visas-que-expirara-el-14-de-marzo-de-2025-nota/)\n\n**Changes to US Immigration Rules: What You Need to Know**\nStarting from March 14, 2025, several changes will affect migrants seeking to enter the United States. These changes will impact certain groups of applicants who have relied on special visa programs to work and live in the country. The new immigration measures are causing concern among those who have used these legal channels to maintain their migratory status. According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the EB-4 visa, intended for certain religious workers, will expire on March 14, 2025. This visa will no longer allow entry or status adjustment for those who are not religious ministers. USCIS warns that those who do not complete their application before the deadline will not be able to continue the process to enter the United States under this category. The change mainly affects non-minister religious workers and their families, who will be forced to seek alternative options. To be eligible for the EB-4 visa, applicants must meet specific criteria, including being a member of a religious organization, having a job offer from a religious organization, and having a bachelor's degree or higher. 'These are the key conditions, according to the official source of USCIS,' said the article. 'The new immigration measures are causing uncertainty, especially for those who are already in the middle of procedures,' said the article. 'The change will affect mainly non-minister religious workers and their families, who will be forced to seek alternative options,' said the article.

This means that from midnight on March 13, no new visas will be issued under this category, and no status adjustments will be completed for applicants in process. They will need to find a new visa option according to their purposes in the country. The EB-4 visa, also known as the 'special immigrant' visa, is one of the five employment-based visa categories that the US grants annually to foreign workers and their families. It is directed at people who perform specific functions within the country. The eligible categories include: However, the cancellation remains exclusive for non-minister religious workers, who, until now, could request the EB-4 visa to perform essential roles in various religious and community organizations. The EB-4 program for non-minister religious workers is subject to periodic legislative renewals, which has caused uncertainty about its continuity. The March 14, 2025 deadline will be the last day to request new visas under this category and complete status adjustments. The program affects non-minister religious workers, who perform crucial functions within religious institutions such as counselors, translators, nuns, and monks, who have been fundamental in immigrant communities and many non-profit organizations, however, this change will not affect ministerial religious workers. The expiration of the program could have repercussions on religious institutions that depend on foreign workers to offer spiritual services, translation, and counseling in immigrant communities. According to a Newsweek report, many non-profit organizations may face difficulties in continuing their mission if this program is not renewed. With the deadline looming, the USCIS mentioned that some applicants may opt for an expedited processing of their visas. For this, non-profit organizations will need to demonstrate that the worker will play an essential role within the community and that there is an urgent need for their entry into the country. Interested parties seeking an EB-4 visa under this category must complete their applications before March 14, 2025. This includes both new visa requests and status adjustments in process. If they do not, they will be forced to explore other migration options, as there will be no new issuances under this category after that date. The urgency of completing applications before the deadline is generating concern among applicants and institutions that may face difficulties in covering key vacancies after the program's closure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 05:27 AM\nSource:[Mundo Deportivo](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/us/actualidad/20250305/717505/estas-problemas-visa-esta-punto-perder-validez-conoce-afectados.html)\n\n**US Ends EB-4 Visa Program for Certain Religious Workers**\nThe US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that the EB-4 visa program for certain religious workers will end on March 14, 2025, as per the law HR 10545, passed on December 21, 2024. This means that from midnight on March 13, no new visas will be granted within this category, and no status adjustments will be finalized for applicants in the process. The EB-4 visa is one of the five employment-based visa categories that the US government grants each year to foreign workers and their families. The program for non-minister religious workers depends on periodic legislative renewals and will only affect those who are not ministers. According to the USCIS, after March 13, 2025, no new SR visas will be granted, and no status adjustments will be allowed within this category, even for approved visas that will only be valid until that date.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 03:37 AM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/mundo/noticias-estados-unidos/articulo/nueva-restriccion-en-estados-unidos-migrantes-con-esta-visa-perderan-el-derecho-a-reingresar/202534/)\n\n**EB-4 Visa Program for Religious Workers to Expire on March 14, 2025**\nThe US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has confirmed that the EB-4 visa program for certain religious workers will expire on March 14, 2025, as per the law HR 10545, signed on December 21, 2024. This means that as of midnight on March 13, no new visas will be issued under this category, and no status adjustments will be completed for applicants in the process. The EB-4 visa is part of the five employment-based visa categories that the US government grants annually to foreign workers and their families. However, within this classification, there is a specific subcategory for non-minister religious workers, whose validity depends on periodic legislative extensions. With the deadline approaching, those seeking to enter the US under this program must complete the process before its expiration. The US government grants around 140,000 immigrant visas per year to foreign workers, organized into different preferences based on their specialization and job functions. The EB-4 visa, also known as the 'special immigrant' visa, is directed at certain groups that perform specific functions within the country. As USCIS Director, 'we must ensure that our immigration system is fair and efficient, and that we are providing the necessary resources to support the needs of our nation.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://www.lapatilla.com/2025/03/05/migrantes-con-esta-visa-no-podran-volver-a-ingresar-a-eeuu-a-partir-del-14mar/)\n\n**Uscis Announces Closure of EB-4 Visa Category for 2025 Fiscal Year**\nThe US Citizenship and Immigration Services (Uscis) announced that all available visas in the Employment-Based Fourth Preference (EB-4) category for the 2025 fiscal year have been issued. According to the Uscis, the annual limit, set by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), means that no more EB-4 visas will be granted until the start of the new fiscal year, October 1, 2025. 'The INA limits the number of employment-based immigrant visas that can be issued within a fiscal year. Specifically, it sets the annual limit for EB-4 visas at 7.1% of the worldwide employment limit', explained the agency in a statement. 'Since all available EB-4 visas for the 2025 fiscal year have been used, embassies and consulates cannot issue the relevant documents in these categories for the remainder of the fiscal year', they added. The EB-4 visa is a employment-based green card category designed for 'special immigrants'. According to the Uscis, this group includes individuals with specific profiles, such as religious workers and young people under judicial protection. The Uscis sets a maximum limit on the number of EB-4 visas that can be issued each fiscal year. For 2025, this limit was reached before expected, leaving thousands of applicants waiting until the next cycle. 'We urge applicants to check the Uscis website for updates on the availability of visas and to consider alternative options, such as filing for a visa in a different category or exploring other immigration pathways', said the Uscis in a statement. 'We understand that this news may be disappointing for some applicants, but we want to assure them that we are working to provide them with the information and resources they need to navigate this process', added the agency.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/visas-y-tramites/cierre-de-ciclo-el-anuncio-del-uscis-que-impacta-en-estos-inmigrantes-especiales-que-buscan-la-green-nid05032025/)\n\n**US Visa Bulletin March 2025: Key Green Card Updates for Indians**\nThe U.S. Department of State has released the Visa Bulletin for March 2025, which includes updates to Final Action Dates for employment-based green card categories.

This decision comes just a month after the application process opened, reflecting a high demand for these temporary work permits. However, there are still options for certain groups of workers. The H-2B visa program is designed to address labor shortages in the US, but is subject to numerical limits. The USCIS reported that the maximum regulatory cap for returning workers was reached after receiving a flood of applications. The process began on December 2, 2024, when the temporary final rule was published, and ended on January 7, 2025. During this period, 20,716 additional H-2B visas were assigned, primarily to employees who had previously worked in the US under this program. Although most H-2B visas have been allocated, the USCIS will continue to accept applications for the remaining cap, which still has available space. USCIS encouraged employers interested in hiring workers from countries with reserved visas to submit their requests as soon as possible, while space is available. For employers whose workers were not selected in the general allocation, this is a crucial opportunity. Additionally, the agency reminded that H-2B additional visas for citizens of the mentioned countries will be available until March 31, 2025, allowing extra time to complete necessary processes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 06:12 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/visa-estados-unidos-uscis-no-recibira-solicitudes-para-permiso-h-2b-PP4233008)\n\n",

Historically, changes to immigration policy in the US, such as substantial changes to programs like EB-5, involve protracted legislative processes, often taking months or years to be enacted. Given this, the historical frequency of an abrupt removal of an online informational page related to a still-active program is low. Additionally, the U.S. government, including USCIS, tends to maintain outdated or transitional webpages for an extended period, even if a program is reformed or repealed.

Only one expert, ClinicalResearchResearchEthicsAgent, initially predicted a low probability (20%) of the page remaining online, which they maintained after phase 2 analysis, citing the absence of specific announcements about the EB-5 page removal and the typical procedural process preventing abrupt changes. Overall, the consensus is that the EB-5 page will likely remain accessible through the forecast date.",
