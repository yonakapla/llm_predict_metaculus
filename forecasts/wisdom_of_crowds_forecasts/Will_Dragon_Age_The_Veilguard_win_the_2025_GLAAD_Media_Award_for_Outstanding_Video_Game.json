        "description": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\" of the LGBT community, \"Boldness and Originality\" of the project, significant \"Cultural Impact\" on mainstream culture, and \"Overall Quality\" of the project. Results are then certified by a \"Review Panel\" who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own \"expert opinions\".\"",

The game's use of Japanese masculine terms to refer to Vivian, contrasted with her use of feminine pronouns and presentation as female, is a notable aspect of its representation. Nintendo has a history of including trans characters in its games, including Birdo in Super Mario Bros. 2 and Nova in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers a more affirming experience, allowing players to define their character's body, gender, and pronouns separately and incorporating their trans identity into the game's story. Other nominees, such as Sorry We're Closed and Dread Delusion, venture into darker territory with queer characters, while games like Minds Beneath Us and Until Then make gender and sexuality key elements of their stories.

The remake included the original dialogue from the Japanese GameCube release, where Vivian is deliberately misgendered by her sisters. GLAAD, a non-profit organization focused on LGBT+ advocacy, celebrates LGBT+ representation in media through its annual awards. Other nominees include Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which feature LGBT+ relationships and characters. According to a GLAAD study, nearly one in five gamers are members of the LGBT+ community, yet LGBT+ storylines and characters account for less than two percent of all games. 'It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation,' said the report. '72 percent of LGBT+ players said seeing characters matching their gender identity or sexual orientation well-represented made them feel better about themselves,' the report added.
