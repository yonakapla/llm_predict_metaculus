        "description": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\" of the LGBT community, \"Boldness and Originality\" of the project, significant \"Cultural Impact\" on mainstream culture, and \"Overall Quality\" of the project. Results are then certified by a \"Review Panel\" who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own \"expert opinions\".\"",

Yasuda notes that the game's poor sales were 'compensated' by the good sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake. The company's third financial quarter (ended in March 2025) saw a decrease in operating profit compared to the same period last year. However, this is not a new trend for Square Enix. The company has not officially commented on the game's success or failure, but the development studio Deck Nine, which created the game, has already laid off part of its team after the game's release. The current state of the Life is Strange franchise is uncertain, with it unclear whether Square Enix will give the green light for a continuation, despite the game's ending message that 'Max Caulfield will return'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 04:19 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0443](https://kanobu.ru/news/smi-poslednyaya-life-is-strange-okazalas-dlya-square-enix-provalnoj-498185/)\n\n**America's Blood Centers Announces 2025 Awards Of Excellence Winners - Pinoy Bisnes Ideas**\nAmerica's Blood Centers (ABC) has announced the winners of its 2025 Awards of Excellence.

Yasuda claims that the game did not perform well commercially, although Square Enix has declined to comment on the game's sales figures. The game's developer, Deck Nine, had to lay off staff shortly after its release, leaving the future of the series uncertain. Yasuda's statement comes as the game's protagonist, Max Caulfield, was promised to return in the game, but it remains to be seen if Square Enix will give the series another chance. As Vandal noted in their analysis, 'what has evolved thematically has not done so as much in terms of gameplay: the dynamic of transitioning between the World of Death and the World of Life refreshes the formula a bit, but not enough to avoid feeling anxious for a renewal, especially because the problems of rhythm that this structure brings with it are still present'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:59 PM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350778937/un-analista-asegura-que-life-is-strange-double-exposure-ha-supuesto-grandes-perdidas-para-square-enix/)\n\n**Square Enix Seemingly Suffered 'Large Losses' With Life Is Strange: Double Exposure**\nSquare Enix has seemingly suffered 'large losses' with the release of Life Is Strange: Double Exposure. This is not the first time the publisher has been disappointed with sales figures, as they sold off several internal Western studios in 2022. The new Life Is Strange game launched this week, and opinions on it are mixed. According to the article, 'this certainly isn't the first time we've heard Square Enix be disappointed in sales figures.' The publisher's struggles with sales figures have led to significant changes, including the sale of internal Western studios.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[purexbox.com](https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/03/square-enix-seemingly-suffered-large-losses-with-life-is-strange-double-exposure)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure reportedly a 'large loss' for Square Enix, says analyst, who adds: 'The company's IP fundamentally varies too much between good and bad'**\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure has reportedly been a 'large loss' for Square Enix, according to analyst Hideki Yasuda. The game's poor performance is attributed to its retreading of old narrative ground from the initial game, rather than introducing new and inventive elements. As PC Gamer's Mollie Taylor said, 'remind me to never become besties with Max Caulfield, lest I end up dead in a ditch somewhere.' The game's SteamDB numbers show a peak of 8,524 players on release, less than half of the hype of the initial game. This, combined with the layoff of 20% of Deck Nine's staff, suggests that the game was not well-received. Analyst Yasuda also stated that Square Enix's IP 'fundamentally varies too much between good and bad,' making performance unstable. The company's president, Takashi Kiryu, has also acknowledged that the 'winning formula is no longer effective.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 01:43 PM\nSource:[pcgamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/life-is-strange-double-exposure-reportedly-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-says-analyst-who-adds-the-companys-ip-fundamentally-varies-too-much-between-good-and-bad/)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure was a \"large loss\" for Square Enix - report**\nSquare Enix has not commented on the performance of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, but according to a report, the game was a 'large loss' for the company. The game's developer, Deck Nine, previously announced layoffs after the game's launch, and the franchise's future is unclear. Square Enix's financial results did not mention Double Exposure's sales figures, but stated that the HD gaming division's revenues fell due to 'new titles generated lower sales' than other games. The company did not specify which titles underperformed, but said that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset the losses. Eurogamer has contacted Square Enix for more detail, but the company has not released a transcript of the financial briefing. The game was met with backlash from fans due to its handling of the storyline and player choice, and Square Enix removed leaked development material from a Life is Strange fan reddit, citing 'intellectual property violations'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:24 AM\nSource:[Eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-was-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-report)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure \u00e8 un flop enorme**\nSquare Enix's Life is Strange: Double Exposure has been a commercial failure, despite high expectations and a nostalgic appeal to the series' protagonist, Max Caufield. The game's poor performance has been acknowledged by the publisher, who has reported 'significant losses' in their latest financial results, as confirmed by analyst Hideki Yasuda of Toyo Securities. The game was criticized for failing to maintain the identity that made the series special, and Square Enix has launched a survey to understand the community's disappointment and evaluate the franchise's future. The commercial failure is particularly symbolic, coming as the series celebrates its 10th anniversary. Square Enix now faces a strategic crossroads, with options including trying again with Max Caufield, exploring new protagonists, or potentially abandoning the IP. The severity of the financial losses may significantly influence the publisher's future decisions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 16, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshw.it/videogioco/life-is-strange-il-nuovo-capitolo-si-rivela-un-insuccesso-2025-03-16)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure - A Commercial Flop for Square Enix**\nLife is Strange: Double Exposure, the latest game in the series, has failed to replicate the success of the first game, despite high expectations from fans and critics. The game, developed by Deck Nine, has been met with disappointment from fans, with many feeling that it has lost the identity of the original Life is Strange series. According to an analyst from Toyo Securities, Hideki Yasuda, the game has caused 'serious losses' for Square Enix, although this was partially offset by the positive sales of the Dragon Quest 3 remake. The poor sales of Double Exposure raise questions about the future of the series, particularly given the anticipation of a possible return of the protagonist Max Caufield in new adventures. Only time will tell if Square Enix will continue to develop the series or try new approaches, as they have done with True Colors, or abandon the IP altogether.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 16, 2025 09:49 AM\nSource:[SpazioGames](https://www.spaziogames.it/notizie/il-nuovo-life-is-strange-e-un-flop-gravi-perdite-per-square-enix)\n\n**Square Enix Nintendo Switch eShop sale: lowest prices ever for Dragon Quest Monsters, Fantasian, Life is Strange, more**\nSquare Enix has launched a massive sale on the Nintendo eShop, offering discounts on several Switch games, including the lowest prices ever for Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, Fantasian Neo Dimension, Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and more.

Despite receiving high praise from media outlets such as IGN, the game has been criticized by players for lacking depth in its choices and handling of characters and endings, with some feeling that the LGBTQ elements are overdone. Although the game's poor sales are not explicitly stated, it is clear that the company has suffered a financial loss. However, the success of 'Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake' has helped to mitigate this loss to some extent. Interestingly, the game's ending credits suggest that the protagonist Max Caulfield from the previous game may return, hinting at the possibility of a sequel. However, following the disappointing sales of 'Life is Strange: Double Exposure', it remains unclear whether a new installment in the series will be released. As Square Enix's financial report states, 'the game's performance was not satisfactory, and we will need to carefully consider our next steps.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 10:24 PM\nSource:[ZOL\u6e38\u620f\u9891\u9053](https://game.zol.com.cn/959/9598726.html)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure - Square Enix's Latest Game is a Commercial Disappointment**\nSquare Enix's latest game, Life is Strange: Double Exposure, has been a commercial disappointment. According to the company's latest financial report, the game failed to meet expectations and was a 'great loss' for the company (via The Gamer). Although Square Enix did not provide exact figures, it is clear that the game did not impress even the most loyal fans of the series. The decision to bring back Max Caulfield seemed like a safe bet, but the execution of her relationship with Chloe and the story fell short. The game's poor sales were somewhat offset by the massive success of the Dragon Quest 3 Remake. This led Square Enix to question what went wrong with Double Exposure, including aspects such as the story, graphics, and other areas that are important for the future of the IP. Despite this, Deck Nine plans to continue using Max Caulfield in a future game, but the disappointing sales raise concerns that the franchise may be in danger of following the same path as Lara Croft and Marvel Avengers, which were sold to Embracer Group after poor sales.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 01:23 AM\nSource:[3D Juegos](https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/life-is-strange-double-exposure/noticias/uno-ultimos-juegos-square-enix-ha-sido-decepcion-ventas-franquicia-life-is-strange-esta-peligro)\n\n**Life is Strange: Double Exposure Causes Significant Financial Damage to Square Enix**\nSquare Enix reported in their latest financial report that the game Life is Strange: Double Exposure caused significant financial damage due to its poor sales performance. The game's commercial performance was far below expectations, resulting in a 'strong negative impact' on the company's financial balance. According to Square Enix, the game's poor performance was so severe that it even overshadowed the massive success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which has sold over 2 million copies worldwide. The poor performance of Double Exposure also lowered Square Enix's profit predictions for the 2024 fiscal year, but the company did not release the total sales figures for the game. Life is Strange: Double Exposure received mixed reviews from critics, with a Metacritic score of 73-75, but was met with negative reception from the public, with a Metacritic user score of 4.3 and a Steam approval rating of 57%. IGN Brasil gave the game a score of 7.5/10, stating, 'Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a good game, but it doesn't come close to the original. Although the story is interesting and leaves room for a sequel, the new entry in the franchise lacks something that made the first game so impactful: a moving story that brings identification to the players. Therefore, Double Exposure cannot be memorable like its narrative predecessor. While the original Life is Strange balanced the relationships between characters with the mystery of the story, Double Exposure seems to leave aside the social aspect of the franchise and focus more on superpowers and their possibilities. A new proposal that still needs to be proven.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[IGN Brasil](https://br.ign.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure/137606/news/life-is-strange-double-exposure-deu-grande-prejuizo-a-square-enix-revela-pusblisher)\n\n**Life is Strange Double Exposure: A New Chapter in the Popular Series at a Discounted Price**\nLife is Strange Double Exposure, the new chapter in the popular Square Enix series, is now available on Xbox Series X/S at a discounted price of \u20ac39, a 34% discount from the recommended price of \u20ac60.99.

Dr. Martens has a long history of being worn by workers, musicians, artists, and various subcultures, and has become a staple of the underground and urban environments. The game also features a collaboration with Polaroid, with Max using the Polaroid Non Generation 2 i-Type camera to take instant photos in the game's photo mode.

Life is Strange: Double Exposure and Dragon Age: The Veilguard also received nods. Last year's winner, Baldur's Gate 3, did not receive a nomination this year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-bioware-amongst-nominees-for-outstanding-video-game-at-36th-glaad-media-awards)\n\n**Nintendo nominated for GLAAD award for trans representation in Paper Mario**\nNintendo has been nominated for a GLAAD award for its Paper Mario remake, which restored the trans identity of character Vivian. The remake included the original dialogue from the Japanese GameCube release, where Vivian is deliberately misgendered by her sisters. GLAAD, a non-profit organization focused on LGBT+ advocacy, celebrates LGBT+ representation in media through its annual awards. Other nominees include Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which feature LGBT+ relationships and characters. According to a GLAAD study, nearly one in five gamers are members of the LGBT+ community, yet LGBT+ storylines and characters account for less than two percent of all games. 'It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation,' said the report. '72 percent of LGBT+ players said seeing characters matching their gender identity or sexual orientation well-represented made them feel better about themselves,' the report added. '68 percent wished there were more prominent LGBT+ storylines.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 05:16 PM\nSource:[Eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-nominated-for-glaad-award-for-trans-representation-in-paper-mario)\n\n",
