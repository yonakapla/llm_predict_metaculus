According to Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez, Secretary of Governance, there will be up to 84,202 polling stations across the country. The voting process will involve six ballots of different colors, each with its own content. The ballots will include the election of federal judges, as well as local judges in 19 federal entities. Rodr\u00edguez explained that citizens will have to choose candidates for each ballot, with specific requirements for each one. For example, the purple ballot will require the election of five women and four men for the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN), while the blue ballot will require the election of one woman and one man for the Magistratures of the Superior Chamber of the Electoral Tribunal of the Judicial Power of the Federation. The government expects over 100,000 citizens to vote in these elections. As Rodr\u00edguez said, 'It is essential to take into account that in the white boxes, you must indicate the number of candidates you want to choose, and in each one, put the number of the candidate you want to choose.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:01 PM\nSource:[SDPnoticias.com](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/mexico/elecciones-poder-judicial-2025-gobierno-de-mexico-explica-como-votar-en-cada-una-de-las-boletas)\n\n**Trump Tariff Tracker -- March 19**\nPresident Trump has announced plans to implement reciprocal tariffs and tariffs on automobiles on April 2.

According to Saulite, the new ballots will feature two fields - red and green - for voters to mark their preferences. 'The old system of ballots caused confusion among voters, as it was not always clear. The new ballots are much easier for citizens. Information on how to fill out the ballots will be available at polling stations,' Saulite explained. The new ballots are set to be used in the next year's elections and in the 2029 European Parliament elections. Additionally, mobile voting stations will be introduced, which will be temporarily set up in crowded areas chosen by local authorities. 'Information about mobile polling stations must be provided 30 days before the elections, so that the CEC can inform the public,' Saulite noted. Another innovation will be 'split' polling stations, which can operate at different addresses at different times. Municipal elections in Latvia are scheduled to take place in early June, with candidate lists to be submitted by April 8.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 01:16 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250319/glava-tsik-izbirateley-zhdut-izmeneniya--29941444.html)\n\n**Mauritian Municipal Elections 2025: Five Days to Register for Supplementary Electoral Register**\nCitizens in five Mauritian cities have five days to register for the supplementary electoral register, which will be in effect from April 4, 2025.

In the previous presidential elections in 2020, the turnout was 64.51% in the first round and 68.18% in the second round. Polish citizens who have turned 18 and have not been deprived of this right by a court judgment are entitled to vote. However, individuals who have been incapacitated or deprived of public rights cannot participate in the elections. Additionally, those who turn 18 after the election date will have to wait for the next opportunity to cast their vote. Voters can cast their ballots in designated polling stations, but those who are outside their place of residence on election day have convenient options. They can obtain a certificate of the right to vote, which allows them to vote in any location in the country or abroad, or they can register to vote in a new location, no later than five days before the election. Polish citizens abroad can also vote in polling stations at Polish consulates, provided they have previously notified the consul. Special polling stations have been designated for people in hospitals, social welfare homes, and prisons. Students can vote at their place of study if they have previously registered in the relevant electoral register. Military personnel and officials on duty on election day will also be able to vote in polling stations at military units.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/prawo/wybory-w-polsce-2025-kto-moze-glosowac-na-prezydenta/n6w884s)\n\n**Tecan publishes agenda for the Annual General Meeting 2025**\nTecan has published the agenda for its Annual General Meeting 2025, which will take place on April 10, 2025.

The ABC's 'Promise Tracker' has not been updated in over 12 months, but still displays the current date.

The AAP secured a landslide victory in the 2020 elections, winning 62 out of 70 seats, but is now facing anti-incumbency pressure and corruption allegations. The campaign has revolved around several critical issues, including promises of free electricity, water subsidies, and financial aid. According to the Election Commission of India, exit poll results will be announced after 6 PM on February 5, following the conclusion of voting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 02:09 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/newsblogs/delhi-elections-2025-live-updates-date-time-constituencies-parties-manifesto-arvind-kejriwal-atishi-paresh-verma-sandeep-dikshit-aap-bjp-congress-delhi-assembly-elections-eci-latest-news-4-february/liveblog/117899103.cms)\n\n**How our Trump approval polling average works**\nFiveThirtyEight (538) has introduced a new methodology for calculating President Donald Trump's approval rating. The new model uses a random walk to predict daily changes in presidential approval, taking into account various factors such as overall public opinion, sampling error, and non-sampling error. The model also accounts for uncertainty in the polling average, allowing for the display of uncertainty intervals directly on the average. This new methodology is an improvement over the previous approach, which had some shortcomings, including the potential for statistical error and sensitivity to noise. The new model is similar to the one used for polls of the 2024 general election and has been used to model approval ratings of government leaders in the United Kingdom and for elections in Australia. According to Nate Silver, the founder of 538, 'Our new model also lets us account for uncertainty in the polling average in a very straightforward way. Imagine we are not calculating support for a president one single time, but thousands of times, where each time we see what his support would be if the data and parameters of our model had different values.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-approval-polling-average-works/story?id=117999010)\n\n**Rockstar Closes Doors to GTA 5 Update Trackers**\nRockstar Games has taken a surprising step that has left the GTA 5 community in a state of confusion. The company has closed the doors to all those who follow and track updates for the game, making it impossible for players and enthusiasts to predict the release date of new content based on internal changes. According to Ben, a knowledgeable individual on the X platform, Valve has implemented new measures on its platform that prevent the collection of this data. This means that players and enthusiasts can no longer rely on SteamDB or other platforms to track updates, and will have to rely on official information from Rockstar. While the exact reasons behind this change are unclear, it is believed that Rockstar is trying to keep its development plans secret to prevent leaks before official announcements. However, this change may also encourage players to enjoy the game as it is, without worrying about future updates.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[vga4a.com](https://www.vga4a.com/archives/254263)\n\n",
