Lawsuit - VG**\nThe Gross Law Firm is reminding shareholders of Venture Global, Inc. (NYSE: VG) of a lead plaintiff deadline of April 18, 2025, in a lawsuit related to the company's initial public offering (IPO) on January 27, 2025. According to the complaint, TotalEnergies, a target customer of Venture, rejected opportunities to become a long-term customer due to lack of trust, citing statements made by the company's CEO. Venture is currently facing legal challenges from existing large clients, such as BP and Shell, due to delays in supply contracts. The Gross Law Firm is seeking recovery on behalf of investors who incurred losses when false and/or misleading statements or the omission of material information by Venture led to artificial inflation of the company's stock. Shareholders who purchased shares of VG during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment.

Other notable departures include Alex Taussig and Nicole Quinn from Lightspeed, Matt Miller from Sequoia, and Sriram Krishnan and Michelle Volz from a16z. These departures are attributed to two concurrent issues facing the industry: evaporating financial incentives and bloated partnerships. Strong performers are restless due to compensation, and the lack of IPOs and acquisitions has limited cash returns, leaving some partners as the odd ones out.
