While some coaches prefer this format, others, like Harvard's Tommy Amaker and Brown's Martin, believe that all eight teams should be included. The Ivy League sponsors postseason tournaments in most of its other sports, but restricts the competition to the top four finishers in regular season play. The current format has led to recent success for the Ivy men's basketball champion, with Yale and Princeton both making deep runs in the NCAA Tournament in recent years. However, coaches and administrators point out that the cost of running an eight-team tournament is a consideration, and that the decision ultimately lies with the eight school presidents and athletic directors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/13/metro/march-sadness-ivy-league-tournament-harvard-brown-princeton-dartmouth/)\n\n**Men's Champ Week tickets punched: 14 of 31 conference tournament winners crowned**\nFourteen conference tournament champions have been crowned in men's college basketball's Champ Week, with more teams competing to cut down the nets in their respective league finals.

The probabilities range from 0% to 40%, with most experts adjusting their forecasts to reflect a modest increase due to Yale's strong performance and historical competitiveness of Ivy League teams as underdogs. However, the overall outlook remains cautious due to the strong competition presented by other conferences, with an average revised probability around 15-20%.",
