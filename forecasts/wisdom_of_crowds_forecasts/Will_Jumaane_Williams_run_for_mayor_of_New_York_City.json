        "description": "According to the NYT, \"Mr. Williams is a progressive leader from Brooklyn who has criticized the mayor\u2019s aggressive policing strategy. He has pledged to rank Mr. Lander either first or second on his ballot.\n\nBut if Mr. Adams were to resign, Mr. Williams \u2014 who ran unsuccessfully for governor and lieutenant governor \u2014 would become acting mayor. He would then likely run for a full term.\"",

He has been endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and has a strong following among young voters. Mamdani's campaign is focused on listening to the concerns of working-class New Yorkers and addressing issues such as corruption, economic hardship, and social justice. He has been praised for his willingness to talk about social issues alongside economic hardship and corruption, and for his commitment to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities. However, he will face stiff competition from other left-leaning candidates, including progressive favorite Brad Lander and liberal titan Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's ability to distinguish himself from the pack and win over voters will be crucial in his bid for the mayoralty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor/)\n\n**The Race to Outrank Cuomo**\nAndrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, is considering a run for mayor of New York City, despite his resignation in disgrace three years ago. Cuomo's universal name recognition and deep executive experience make him a formidable candidate, but his opponents are trying to exploit his vulnerabilities, including his handling of sexual-harassment scandals and his pandemic response. Brad Lander, the progressive city comptroller, is aiming to be the primary alternative to Cuomo, but he faces a major challenge in winning over voters beyond his affluent Brooklyn base. Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker, has entered the fray, but she faces a significant fundraising gap and will need to play catch-up with the other Democrats. The use of ranked-choice voting in the primary could impact the outcome, and some are speculating that Cuomo's superior name recognition will carry the day, while others believe that RCV can punish polarizing candidates like Cuomo.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-race-to-outrank-andrew-cuomo.html)\n\n**City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams enters race for mayor**\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has announced her candidacy for mayor, becoming the 10th Democrat to join the race. Adams stated, 'New Yorkers can't afford to live here, City Hall is in chaos, and Donald Trump is corrupting our city's independence. It's time to stand up.' She aims to serve the people of New York City, not her own interests. Political experts say she could be a viable alternative, but her late entry into the race and lack of a campaign make it an uphill climb. Adams' appeal to Black voters in southeast Queens and Brooklyn could siphon off support from Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Her team hopes she will be the choice of dissatisfied New Yorkers. Mayor Adams responded, 'Come one, come all,' and questioned the motives of her competitors. During her tenure as Council Speaker, Adams has clashed with Mayor Adams on issues like housing vouchers and mayoral appointments. She has taken up progressive causes and claims to be above labels, focusing on public service. Adams is expected to host a campaign kickoff rally in Queens on Saturday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[nystateofpolitics.com](https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2025/03/06/city-council-speaker-adrienne-adams-announces-mayoral-run)\n\n**NYC mayor's race heats up as Mayor Eric Adams touts decreases in gun violence and Andrew Cuomo spars with Brad Lander**\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams touted decreases in gun violence, saying the city is the 'safest big city in America.' He criticized opponents who claim the city is in chaos and crisis, saying 'the numbers don't lie.' Adams pointed to a 21.5% decrease in shootings in January and a 20.8% decrease in February, the lowest in the city's recorded history. Meanwhile, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo picked up the endorsement of the electrical workers union, IBEW Local 3, and slammed opponents like City Comptroller Brad Lander over public safety. Cuomo called for e-bike regulations and financial liability for food delivery companies in accidents caused by riders. Lander continued to slam Cuomo over the sexual harassment charges that led to his resignation as governor, saying he should return $60 million to taxpayers and put it to public safety.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:53 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-city-mayoral-race-eric-adams-andrew-cuomo-brad-lander/)\n\n**Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo focus on crime as race for New York City mayor heats up**\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are focusing on crime as a key issue in the mayoral election. Despite declining crime rates, Cuomo claims the city is 'out-of-control' and has proposed hiring 5,000 additional police officers and cracking down on e-bikes. Adams argues that the problem is bail reform, which he believes allows repeat offenders to be released back onto the streets. A recent poll shows that 55% of New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Adams, while 51% have a favorable view of Cuomo. However, Democrats will decide the primary, and Cuomo has received three major union endorsements in the past three weeks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:01 PM\nSource:[ABC7 New York](https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-mayoral-race-eric-adams-andrew-cuomo-focus-crime-biggest-issues-facing-candidates/16003755/)\n\n**Barry Diller backs Andrew Cuomo's bid for NYC mayor out of...**\nMedia mogul Barry Diller has endorsed former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's bid for New York City mayor, citing 'gratitude' for Cuomo's support of his Hudson River real estate development, Little Island. Diller stated, 'I think he'd be a very good mayor of New York. I don't think [current mayor Eric] Adams will or should survive politically.' Diller also expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party, calling their reaction to President Trump's address to Congress 'pathetic and unfortunate.' Cuomo announced his candidacy last week, and polls show he would be the heavy favorite in the Democratic mayoral primary, scheduled for June 24.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 03:53 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/business/barry-diller-backs-andrew-cuomos-bid-for-nyc-mayor/)\n\n**How Much Has Cuomo Scrambled the Mayoral Race?**\nThe New York City mayoral race has been shaken up by the entry of former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is challenging Mayor Eric Adams for his seat. Cuomo's moderate policies and high name recognition could make him a strong contender, but he also faces criticism for his past controversies, including allegations of sexual harassment and corruption. Meanwhile, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has also joined the race, offering a moderate alternative to Cuomo and Adams. Dr. Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, believes that Cuomo's entry could be an opportunity for other challengers, such as Zellnor Myrie and Zohran Mamdani, to gain traction by framing their policy issues in a way that contrasts with Cuomo's baggage. The field is crowded, and ranked-choice voting could lead to unpredictable results, but Greer thinks that Adrienne Adams could be a strong contender if she can raise money and get signatures to be on the stage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-much-has-andrew-cuomo-scrambled-the-mayoral-race.html)\n\n**The Race for the NYC Democratic Nomination**\nTen candidates are running for the Democratic nomination in the NYC mayoral election, challenging incumbent Eric Adams. Adams has faced low approval ratings and investigations into allegations of bribery and straw donations. His campaign website emphasizes his working-class background and commitment to making NYC safer and more affordable. Other candidates include Andrew Cuomo, a former governor and U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment; Brad Landers, the NYC Comptroller and a progressive politician; Zohran, who wants to freeze rent, improve public transportation, and raise the minimum wage; Zellnor, a NY state senator who supports abortion rights and climate change regulations; Ramos, a NY state senator who has advocated for workers' rights and union support; Stringer, a former NYC Comptroller and Manhattan Borough President who has been accused of sexual harassment; and Adrienne Adams, a city councilor and speaker who has been a vocal critic of Mayor Adams and is running on the slogan 'Somebody has to be the voice of the soul of the city.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/the-race-for-the-nyc-democratic-nomination-5822735)\n\n**For #MeToo Movement, Mayor's Race in New York City Poses a Test**\nThe #MeToo movement is being tested in New York City's mayoral race, where three Democratic candidates - Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, and Scott Stringer - have faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Cuomo has denied the allegations, while Adams and Stringer have also denied the claims, with Adams' accuser, Lorna Beach-Mathura, saying she was glad that voters would now 'be more informed about who Eric Adams is.' The allegations have been a challenge for the candidates, with Cuomo facing a defamation lawsuit from one of his accusers, and Adams facing federal corruption charges. The #MeToo movement has faced setbacks, but it has not disappeared, according to law professor Suzanne B. Goldberg. Some women say the presence of three male candidates with #MeToo allegations underscores the urgency to elect the city's first female mayor, with two women running: Ms. Ramos and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker. Ms. Ramos said in a statement that voters deserved better choices on the ballot, 'If people think their only choice is between a sex pest and a corrupt liar, of course they're not going to think government can work for them.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/nyregion/cuomo-stringer-metoo-harassment.html)\n\n**Barry Diller backs Andrew Cuomo's mayoral bid**\nMedia mogul Barry Diller is supporting Andrew Cuomo's bid for New York City mayor, citing Cuomo's help in building the city's Little Island public park.

She cited the city's affordability crisis, City Hall's chaos, and Donald Trump's influence as reasons for her decision. 'New Yorkers can't afford to live here, City Hall is in chaos, and Donald Trump is corrupting our city's independence. It's time to stand up,' she said. Adams has low name recognition and will need to quickly fundraise and build a team with fewer than four months until the June 24 Democratic primary. She has the support of public advocate Jumaane Williams, who said, 'I am very excited about Adrienne. Very excited. I want to see what she brings.' Adams' entrance speaks to dissatisfaction with the mayor, who received a paltry 20 percent approval rating in a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 02:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/another-eric-adams-rival-jumping-022713001.html)\n\n**Speaker's final State of the City address doubles as potential mayoral campaign launch  --  Queens Daily Eagle**\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams delivered her fourth annual State of the City address, which some saw as a potential mayoral campaign launch. Adams highlighted the Council's accomplishments and outlined her vision for city leadership, centered around collaboration and 'collective power.' She also took shots at Mayor Eric Adams and President Donald Trump, and rejected labels of being a 'moderate' in a progressive-dominated race. Adams proposed several initiatives for her final year leading the Council, including expanding 7-day library service and creating a Minority-Owned Business Accelerator. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams praised Adams' focus on service and effectiveness, and her agenda for strengthening public health and safety, expanding housing access, and protecting all New Yorkers.

According to a source, James is exploring the possibility of Adams running for mayor. The source also mentioned that the Democratic Party is looking for a candidate other than Cuomo, as the current candidates are unable to beat him. Adams' name was first seriously discussed as a potential mayoral candidate last weekend, when she attended the annual event of the New York State ABPRHAL in Albany, where she reportedly had a conversation with James. James has also been privately contacting high-ranking Democrats to gauge their interest in Adams running for mayor. Adams has recently called for the resignation of current Mayor Eric Adams, and her city council has taken a stance on criminal justice issues that differs from the conservative views of the mayor and the NYPD. She has also supported a controversial bill, the 'How Many Stops Act', which was opposed by the mayor and the NYPD but ultimately passed. If Mayor Adams were to resign or be removed from office, who would become the acting mayor? According to the New York City Charter, the Public Advocate would take over as acting mayor. The current Public Advocate is Jumaane Williams, who served as a city council member from the 45th district in Brooklyn from 2010 to 2019.

Martin Dolan, a Democrat and former banker, plans to run against Williams in the June primary for public advocate. Dolan has criticized Williams, saying he has been a 'complete disaster' as public advocate and would be a 'complete disaster' as mayor. Williams has said he is preparing for the scenario of becoming mayor and has been meeting with business leaders to reassure them that he would not use the position to enact his own policy agenda. He has also said he would run for election outright in the nonpartisan special election he would be required to schedule within 80 days. Williams' supporters attribute his popularity to his authenticity and integrity, and he has been open about his struggles with mental health and his family's difficulties. 'You need a public advocate who's trying to pack jobs into New York, who's pro-business, who's pro-lower taxes,' Dolan said. 'Let's make the city's economic architecture as appealing as possible for families and businesses.' Williams 'stands for everything that's the opposite of that,' Dolan added. Williams has said he is 'pragmatic' and believes in 'pragmatic optimism,' and that compromises are an essential part of governing.

However, he has reached out to Republican county leaders, sparking speculation about his intentions. Meanwhile, Adams's challengers are gaining momentum, with some receiving significant endorsements and fund-raising support.

While precise historical data specific to similar scenarios in NYC politics isn't readily available, there are numerous examples in U.S. politics where individuals leverage acting positions into campaign runs. The pattern can be illustrated by the fact that interim leaders often pursue the position permanently, with an observed preliminary probability of approximately 30%.",

In phase 2, after considering new developments such as competition from other prominent candidates and Williams' plans to seek re-election as Public Advocate, most experts lowered their probabilities. Revised probabilities now range from 30% to 80%, reflecting a mix of continued political ambition but also realistic assessments of the competitive landscape. Overall, the likelihood of Williams running appears more uncertain, with significant competition and his current political focus as factors.",
