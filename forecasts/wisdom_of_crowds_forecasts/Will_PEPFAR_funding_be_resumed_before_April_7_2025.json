        "description": "PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, is a United States governmental initiative to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Launched by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2003, [as of April 2024](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/) PEPFAR had provided about \\$120 billion in cumulative funding for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and research since its inception, making it the largest global health program focused on a single disease in history until the COVID-19 pandemic. PEPFAR [has saved](https://theconversation.com/pepfar-funding-to-fight-hiv-aids-has-saved-26-million-lives-since-2003-how-cutting-it-will-hurt-africa-250413) over 26 million lives, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/) an executive order pausing for 90 days new foreign aid disbursements [including for the PEPFAR program](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs/), pending a review of all foreign assistance programs. On February 13, 2025, federal judge Amir Ali [ordered](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-reinstate-foreign-aid-funding-now-rcna192168) the Trump Administration to resume foreign aid programs in place before Trump's inauguration. On February 20, 2025, Judge Ali [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-not-complying-foreign-aid-amir-ali-rcna193092) that the Trump Administration was not fully in compliance with the order.\n\nAfter a long bipartisan consensus about the program's usefulness, in recent years PEPFAR has faced [increased opposition](https://rollcall.com/2023/09/21/pepfar-reauthorization-debate-highlights-splits-in-gop/) in the US Congress, particularly from members of the Republican Party. In 2024 PEPFAR [received](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/pepfars-short-term-reauthorization-sets-an-uncertain-course-for-its-long-term-future/) temporary reauthorization from Congress amid the increasing opposition. See for example [this report](https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/reassessing-americas-30-billion-global-aids-relief-program) from the Heritage Foundation.\n\nAccording to [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/pepfar-funding-to-fight-hiv-aids-has-saved-26-million-lives-since-2003-how-cutting-it-will-hurt-africa-250413) on March 4, 2025:&#x20;\n\n> \\[A]s of this writing, despite a\u00a0[court order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69628254/21/global-health-council-v-donald-j-trump/)\u00a0to resume funding, it remains entirely frozen, and most programmes are still shut down. The day after the court ordered the government to pay\u00a0[nearly US\\$2 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/25/usaid-funding-trump-administration-court/)\u00a0it owes organisations for work already done, the administration revealed that it had terminated the vast majority of foreign assistance awards,\u00a0[including some for Pepfar](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-usaid-foreign-aid.html). Details have not been made public. Meanwhile, the\u00a0[US Supreme Court put a short-term pause](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-usaid-foreign-aid.html)\u00a0on the lower court\u2019s order to immediately pay the money already owed.",

The agency's funding for foreign assistance was paused, and many projects were shut down, leaving thousands of people without access to life-saving medication, food, and other essential services. The purge of USAID has imperiled the very existence of the humanitarian and development industries, and without support from USAID, large-scale projects are unlikely to continue. The agency's history is marked by a tension between its diplomatic and developmental aspects, and its efforts to develop postcolonial nations have largely failed. Despite some bright moments, such as the success of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), USAID's history is also marked by failures and criticisms. The agency's collapse has left a power vacuum, and China and Russia may gain the upper hand in the Global South. The consequences of the Trump administration's actions will be felt for years to come.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/03/12/usaid-goodbye-to-all-that/)\n\n**Confartigianato Warns Entrepreneurs to Act with Caution on Catastrophe Risk Insurance**\nConfartigianato Imprese Macerata-Ascoli Piceno-Fermo is advising entrepreneurs to act with caution when it comes to the new obligation to purchase catastrophe risk insurance. The association is receiving calls from its members who are being contacted by insurance companies and banks with various proposals, and is warning against rushing into decisions. 'We are receiving calls from our associates who are being contacted multiple times by insurance companies and banks, presenting them with commercial proposals that they claim are advantageous,' said Confartigianato. 'We believe that this is creating a lot of confusion among companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the resources to study their individual cases and understand the adequacy of the insurance coverage.' Confartigianato is suggesting that entrepreneurs wait for clarification from the legislature, which is expected in the coming days, before making any decisions. 'We are waiting for clarification from the legislature, which will be precious in drafting a policy that is tailored to our needs,' said Confartigianato. 'It is essential to note that from April 1st, companies with active contributions and access to funding will not lose their benefits: it is therefore advisable not to rush into procedures.' \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[Cronache Maceratesi](https://www.cronachemaceratesi.it/2025/03/12/polizza-rischi-catastrofali-troppa-confusione-imprenditori-agite-con-prudenza/1939892/)\n\n**Clean Air Program to Resume in April with 10 Billion Z\u0142 Funding**\nThe 'Czyste powietrze' (Clean Air) program is set to resume at the beginning of April, according to Polish Minister of Climate and Environment Paulina Hennig-Kloska. The program will be funded by 10 billion z\u0142 from the European Investment Bank's Modernization Fund, which will allow for the program to be shaped freely for the next one to two years. The decision from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBI) is expected in March. Hennig-Kloska stated, 'I believe that we will receive good news in March. I have the first information that we will soon have access to a new budget for this program (...). 10 billion z\u0142 from the European Investment Bank, from the Modernization Fund, will allow us to freely shape this program for the next one to two years.' The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFO\u015aiGW) submitted a request for 10 billion z\u0142 to the EBI in February to finance the program. The funds come from the Modernization Fund, and the EBI's approval is required. The program was temporarily suspended in November 2024 due to concerns about its reform and the need to tighten the system to prevent fraud. The NFO\u015aiGW informed that without the suspension, there would have been even more cases of deceived individuals and embezzled funds by unscrupulous contractors.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Wraca-program-Czyste-powietrze-Minister-podala-termin-8906123.html)\n\n**Trump is cancelling a republican project to wipe out AIDS, putting millions of lives at risk**\nThe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar), a program established by George W. Bush in 2003, has been severely cut by the Trump administration. Pepfar, which accounts for around 70% of the total funding for the global response to HIV, has been included in the administration's attack on U.S. aid spending. The program, which was funding the treatment of over 20 million people across 55 countries, supporting over 90% of the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent new infections, and funding the testing of 83.8 million people in 2024, has been 'gutted' in its current form. The importance of Pepfar as a tool of global soft power and its bipartisan support had led many to assume it would survive the administration's reductions of aid. However, the program's decline was accelerated by growing Republican hostility, including criticism over the funding of abortions in Mozambique. The ending of U.S. support for global HIV programs is a disaster for those in low and middle-income countries, with a report suggesting that ending U.S. support could lead to an additional 565,000 new infections and 601,000 more deaths over the next decade.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 01:40 AM\nSource:[Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-trump-cancelling-republican-aids-millions.html)\n\n**Why The Health Of The Most Vulnerable Will Suffer Under The Trump Administration**\nThe Trump administration's policy shifts on health and global health will have devastating consequences for the most vulnerable populations in America and around the world. The cuts to USAID's foreign aid contracts, which equate to billions of dollars in aid to fight infectious diseases like malaria, will lead to 15 million additional malaria cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally. The funding cuts for tuberculosis programs will disrupt drug supply chains and laboratory services, resulting in 3,600 tuberculosis deaths and 6,400 new cases. The President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has been impacted, and if funding is not restored, about 1 million people will die every year. Additionally, the termination of the Health Equity Advisory Committee for Medicare and Medicaid Services will exacerbate racial disparities in healthcare, and the future of Medicaid remains uncertain, with potential cuts that could drop millions of Americans from the program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 12:31 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/03/11/why-the-health-of-the-most-vulnerable-will-suffer-under-the-trump-administration/)\n\n**Trump is cancelling a Republican project to wipe out AIDS  --  putting millions of lives at risk**\nThe Trump administration has cancelled the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar), a program that has been instrumental in reducing the global HIV epidemic. Pepfar, established by George W. Bush in 2003, has been funding the treatment of over 20 million people, including 560,000 children, across 55 countries. The program has been a rare example of bipartisan support in the US, but was included in the Trump administration's attack on US aid spending. The cancellation of Pepfar is expected to lead to an additional 565,000 new infections and 601,000 more deaths over the next decade, particularly in low and middle-income countries where the program accounts for a significant portion of the HIV prevention and treatment budget. 'It has been a remarkable fall for an organisation that at the was funding the treatment of more than 20 million people (including over 560,000 children) across 55 countries; supporting over 90% of the use of pre-exposure phrophylaxis to prevent new infections; funding the testing of 83.8 million people in 2024 (up from 71 million the previous year); and was directly supporting 342,000 health workers across the world.' said a report. The end of Pepfar is a disaster for those in low and middle-income countries, and rebuilding a global HIV response less dependent on any single donor is essential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 06:23 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/governance/trump-is-cancelling-a-republican-project-to-wipe-out-aids-putting-millions-of-lives-at-risk)\n\n**Africa: Ending Aids, Malaria and TB Is an Urgent Imperative**\nEnding AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) is within reach, but the gains made over the last two decades are in jeopardy due to the US government's potential retreat from global health leadership.

They highlight the challenges in global health, including the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the implementation of 'Stop Work Orders', which have already disrupted health programs in Africa. The authors stress that investing in health is a moral and strategic imperative, citing the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has cut the combined death rate from these diseases by 63% over the last two decades, saving 65 million lives. They call on African leaders to play their part in fighting major infectious diseases and support continued investments in international financing for health. The Global Fund's Eighth Replenishment, with a target of US$18 billion, aims to save 23 million lives between 2027 and 2029 and reduce deaths from these diseases by 64% compared to 2023 levels. 'It's essential that African advocates raise up their voices this time to ensure that our leaders don't step back from the fight against these diseases before the battle is won,' Ngou and Mburu emphasize.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 05:23 AM\nSource:[allAfrica](https://allafrica.com/stories/202503110010.html)\n\n**Trump is cancelling a Republican project to wipe out Aids - putting millions of lives at risk**\nThe US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) has been severely cut by the Trump administration, putting millions of lives at risk. Pepfar, which was established by George W. Bush in 2003, has been a major success in tackling the global HIV epidemic, with a 51% reduction in deaths and a 39% reduction in new infections since 2010. However, the programme has been included in the Trump administration's attack on US aid spending, and funding has been suspended. This is a disaster for those in low and middle-income countries, where Pepfar supports around 70% of the global response to HIV. The immediate challenge is to fund ongoing treatment, but even if new funding can be found, the knock-on impact will be serious, with an estimated 565,000 new infections and 601,000 more deaths over the next decade. The former head of UNAids, Peter Piot, has raised the prospect of countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia running out of anti-HIV drugs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:26 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/trump-is-cancelling-a-republican-project-to-wipe-out-aids-putting-millions-of-lives-at-risk-251198)\n\n**South Africa\u2019s HIV/AIDS fight faces setback as US cuts PEPFAR funding**\nSouth Africa's fight against HIV/AIDS is facing a setback due to the US cutting funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program. According to the Department of Health's annual report, 95% of people living with HIV are aware of their status, 79% are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 93% of those on ART achieved viral suppression at 12 months. However, without PEPFAR funding, over 222,000 South Africans living with HIV, including 7,445 children under 15, face disruptions in ART supplies. UNAIDS estimates that 4,280 NGOs and 15,374 HIV response staff will be affected. The National Department of Health has released contingency measures to maintain uninterrupted HIV services, but the impact of funding cuts could result in an increase of 30,000 to 64,000 new HIV infections and 600 to 1,200 additional AIDS-related deaths by 2028. As Medical Science expert Jayshri Rangasamy notes, 'it is imperative that we closely monitor the situation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the true impact that the funding cuts will have on our HIV care and essential services.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[briefly.co.za](https://briefly.co.za/editorial/opinion/210864-south-africas-hivaids-fight-faces-setback-cuts-pepfar-funding/)\n\n**Pepfar funding to fight HIV/Aids has saved 26 million lives since 2003: how cutting it will hurt Africa**\nThe US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) has been a cornerstone of global HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment for over two decades. Since its inception in 2003, Pepfar has saved 26 million lives and prevented nearly 8 million babies from being born with HIV. However, the program's future is uncertain due to recent political discord and major disruption. In January 2024, Pepfar reported that four nurses in Mozambique had used Pepfar funding to perform abortions, which led to a freeze on funds. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing all further disbursements and new obligations of foreign assistance funds for 90 days. As a result, Pepfar programs were severely impacted, with many organizations forced to lay off staff and turn away patients. The impact has been immediate, with people on HIV treatment unable to pick up additional medicine, leading to treatment interruption. The future of Pepfar remains unclear, with much depending on the courts and whether the administration implements court orders. In the longer term, Congress could seek to resume Pepfar to its former strength, though this would mean acting against the administration's wishes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/pepfar-funding-to-fight-hiv-aids-has-saved-26-million-lives-since-2003-how-cutting-it-will-hurt-africa-250413)\n\n**U.S. cuts to HIV/AIDS funding will be detrimental for vulnerable groups in Kenya**\nThe US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has invested over US$100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response since 2003. However, the program's funding is set to end in April, which will have severe impacts on vulnerable groups in Kenya, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender people. The PEPFAR-funded partnership between the University of Manitoba and the Sex Worker Outreach Program (SWOP) has been critical in reducing HIV prevalence in Kenya, with groundbreaking research findings that have informed global prevention strategies. If PEPFAR funding ends, it will jeopardize STI and HIV services, leaving key groups more vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and human rights abuse. The University of Manitoba's research team is calling on Canada's provincial and federal governments to step in and become leaders in global health and the fight against HIV.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[canadianinquirer.net](https://canadianinquirer.net/2025/02/25/u-s-cuts-to-hiv-aids-funding-will-be-detrimental-for-vulnerable-groups-in-kenya/)\n\n**Comprehensive update on HIV programmes in the Dominican Republic - Dominican Republic**\nThe HIV programmes in the Dominican Republic are facing challenges due to shifts in US funding and political dynamics. PEPFAR-funded programmes, which were stopped, are now being resumed, but the process has been slow. Other activities, such as PrEP for key populations and Community-Led Monitoring, remain on hold. The new Global Fund grant, which started in January 2025, has not yet been implemented at the site level. The suspension of funding has raised concerns about Haitian migrants not having access to their treatment programmes, and the absence of USAID-funded staff and transportation services may impact service accessibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/dominican-republic/comprehensive-update-hiv-programmes-dominican-republic)\n\n**The Outlook for PEPFAR in 2025 and Beyond**\nPEPFAR, the U.S. global HIV/AIDS program, is facing significant challenges that could impede its ability to fulfill its mission. The program's current short-term authorization expires on March 25, 2025, and Congress is increasingly looking for program reforms and ultimately scale down. PEPFAR has been affected by President Trump's foreign aid funding freeze, which has disrupted services and led to increases in HIV-related deaths and new HIV infections. The program has also been impacted by the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, which requires foreign non-governmental organizations to certify that they will not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. Additionally, PEPFAR's reliance on USAID, which is being dismantled, poses a significant risk to the program's operations. The future of PEPFAR is uncertain, with concerns raised by some members of Congress about abortion and increasing pressure on the program to demonstrate more concrete plans about its future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[kff.org](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-outlook-for-pepfar-in-2025-and-beyond/)\n\n**US Government's Freeze on PEPFAR Funds Sparks Concerns for Global HIV Patients**\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) has expressed concern over the US government's temporary freeze on the 'President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief' (PEPFAR) and other foreign aid funds, which has had an immediate impact on people living with HIV (PLHIV) globally.

Although MSF does not receive funding from the US government and will not be directly affected by the freeze on PEPFAR, many of its operations depend on the interrupted programs. 'The uncertainty surrounding the US decision to suspend funding for PEPFAR puts the lives of millions of people at risk,' MSF said. 'The announcement in January to suspend support for the HIV/AIDS plan and the subsequent explanation that 'some treatment programs may continue at least until April' have caused 'confusion and uncertainty' about the prospects for continued medical care. Such 'uncertainty around PEPFAR puts millions of people at risk.' MSF is urging the US government to immediately resume funding for the full range of PEPFAR operations and other critical medical and humanitarian aid,' said Avril Beno\u00eet, executive director of the MSF US office. According to MSF, the consequences of the PEPFAR funding freeze are already visible in African countries south of the Sahara. For example, in Mozambique, MSF's partner organization was forced to completely stop its activities. In Zimbabwe, most organizations providing HIV services have also stopped working, disrupting, in particular, a program aimed at reducing the number of new HIV cases among adolescent girls and young women. The World Health Organization has also expressed concern over the suspension of US funding for PEPFAR. Its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on February 12 that it had led to 'immediate cessation of HIV treatment, testing, and prevention services in 50 countries receiving PEPFAR support.' 'We ask the US to consider continuing funding, at least until solutions are found,' Ghebreyesus said.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 08:25 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/23139751)\n\n**US Funding Freeze for AIDS Relief Puts 'Millions of People' at Risk, Warns MSF**\nM\u00e9dicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) has warned that the US government's decision to temporarily freeze funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) puts 'millions of people' at risk. According to MSF, many people have already had their HIV treatments interrupted due to the temporary freeze of PEPFAR funds, as well as all external aid for at least 90 days. Although the US government clarified that certain HIV treatment programs can continue until April, MSF expressed concern. 'Despite a limited exemption that covers some activities, what our teams are seeing in many of the countries where we work is that many people have already lost access to vital treatments and don't know if they will continue to receive them or when,' said Avril Benoit, MSF's executive director in the US. Benoit urged the US to 'immediately' resume funding for all operations, as the US government's guidance on the programs that will continue leaves out 'key areas of prevention, treatment, care, and follow-up for HIV patients.' Essential services such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for all vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ individuals and sex workers, as well as specific interventions for adolescents and young women in high-prevalence countries, were excluded from the programs that the US will continue to fund. MSF denounced that the effects of the US funding freeze have already been felt in many countries where they have HIV/AIDS programs, such as South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan. Additionally, MSF stated that it is unclear when and how even the limited activities that are allowed can be resumed, as the external aid freeze and suspension of work continue to affect other agencies such as USAID and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 'These interruptions will cost lives and end years of progress against this virus,' Benoit concluded.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/congelacion-de-fondos-para-el-sida-por-parte-de-eu-pone-en-riesgo-a-millones-de-personas-alerta-medicos-sin-fronteras/)\n\n**Embassy confirms Pepfar projects will restart  --  despite Trump's aid ban**\nThe US Embassy in Tshwane confirmed that projects funded by the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) are exempt from President Donald Trump's executive order banning foreign aid to South Africa.

According to John Sifton, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, 'President Trump's sudden suspension of US foreign aid has forced health programs all over the world to halt or curtail operations, including HIV prevention programs, and deny patients lifesaving medicines.' The suspensions have already begun affecting programming to prevent HIV, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV and PEPFAR's delivery of essential medicines to over 20 million people with HIV.

    "summary": "After considering the initial and updated analyses across various experts, the likelihood of PEPFAR funding resuming before April 7, 2025, has generally decreased. Initially, probabilities ranged from 30% to 60%, with factors such as judicial pressure, historical bipartisan support, and legal challenges influencing the forecasts. However, phase 2 updates, informed by recent news articles, indicate the Trump administration's continued resistance to resuming full funding and significant political and administrative hurdles. Despite some exemptions and waivers allowing limited PEPFAR activities, experts revised their probabilities downward, reflecting these challenges and a consensus that full resumption by the deadline is unlikely. Revised probabilities generally range from 10% to 45%.",
