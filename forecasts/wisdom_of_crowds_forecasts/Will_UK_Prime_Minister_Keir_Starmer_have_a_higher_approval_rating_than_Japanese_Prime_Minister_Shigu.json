He added that the UK will do everything to restore the ceasefire, release the remaining prisoners, and deliver urgent aid. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy previously accused Israel of violating international law by blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, saying, 'This is a violation of international law. Israel has the right to ensure its own security, but the last aid to enter Gaza was 15 days ago. The lack of aid is unacceptable.'

The Labour leader was grilled by Kemi Badenoch over the Government's welfare reforms, including a \u00a35 billion cut to benefits. Starmer defended the reforms, saying the current benefits system is 'morally and economically indefensible'. He also revealed that he is watching the Netflix drama 'Adolescence' with his children to provide them with better role models. The Prime Minister's Questions session also touched on issues such as youth homelessness, the SNP's record on the issue, and the resumption of Israeli military action in Gaza.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-refuses-rule-extending-stealth-143152400.html)\n\n**Starmer: I am deeply concerned about Israel's renewed attacks on Gaza**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed great concern over Israel's renewed attacks on Gaza, stating, 'The images of parents carrying their children to the hospital over the past few days and the number of people being killed are truly shocking.'

Starmer has had his best weeks in office, positioning himself as a leader in European diplomacy during the Ukraine crisis. However, his domestic policy is causing controversy, particularly with the announcement of a plan to cut social benefits for disabled people. The plan, which will make it harder for people to receive the Personal Independence Payment and reduce the age limit for claiming disability benefits, is a cost-cutting measure aimed at reducing social spending by \u00a35 billion by 2020. According to Labour Minister Elizabeth Kendall, the reform will 'facilitate integration into the labor market', but critics argue that it will harm vulnerable groups. Starmer's approval ratings have risen, but his social policy is now facing opposition from within his own party. As Kendall said, 'It was a great day' for the government's economic plans, but for many, it's a step in the wrong direction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:33 PM\nSource:[Die Presse](https://www.diepresse.com/19485125/starmer-bringt-mit-sparkurs-den-linken-parteifluegel-gegen-sich-auf)\n\n**UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Increased Support for Ukraine: A Shift in Global Politics**\nAccording to Egor Chernyev, the head of the VR delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a key global reason is driving the UK to increasingly support Ukraine.

However, Starmer's approval ratings at home are also in decline due to controversies such as axing a winter fuel repayment program and policy reversals on political donations. According to Colin Brazier, Starmer's approval ratings have 'fallen faster than almost any previous incumbent' due to new taxes and a sense of 'undeveloping' Britain. Despite this, Alan Mendoza, Executive Director of the Henry Jackson Society, believes that the meeting could be an opportunity for Starmer to gain points at home while soothing diplomatic ties. Mendoza pointed to the successful meeting between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron as an indicator of how Starmer's discussions could go. The meeting is expected to address topics such as U.S.-U.K. defense alliances, support for Ukraine, and shared economic and trade-based partnerships.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 09:12 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/uks-starmer-juggles-trouble-at-home-he-walks-geopolitical-tightrope-trump)\n\n**Keir is less popular than every PM of last 5 decades  --  apart from Truss**\nA YouGov poll has found that Sir Keir Starmer is less popular than every Prime Minister of the last five decades, except for Liz Truss. The poll ranked Sir Tony Blair as the most popular, followed by Lady Thatcher, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, John Major, Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Theresa May. The survey is a further blow to the PM, who is now polling behind Reform ahead of May's local elections. Another poll revealed that if an election were held tomorrow, 27% of Brits would vote for Reform, ahead of 25% for Labour and 21% for the Tories. Nigel Farage has a net favourability rating of -30, while Sir Keir's rating is -40, with 66% of respondents having an unfavourable view compared to 26% favourable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 10:42 PM\nSource:[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/33465942/keir-starmer-least-popular-pm-liz-truss/)\n\n**Starmer Becomes Second Least Popular British Government Leader in 46 Years**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the second least popular British government leader in 46 years, according to a YouGov poll. The poll results show that Starmer has the lowest approval rating compared to all his predecessors, except Liz Truss.

When compared to Tony Blair, 45% of respondents said Blair was a better prime minister, while just 10% preferred Starmer. The results were similar for Margaret Thatcher, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, and John Major, with each of them beating Starmer in the poll. Even Rishi Sunak, who led the Conservatives to a historic defeat, came out on top with 33% of respondents preferring him over Starmer. However, Starmer did manage to beat Liz Truss, with 43% of respondents saying he was a better prime minister.

The Labour Party's approval rating has dropped to 27%, with the Reform party gaining ground.

Typically, approval ratings of leaders from both countries can range from 30% to 60%, but this varies significantly depending on current events. An initial probability can be based on the simple expectation of a 50-50 chance that one leader will have a higher rating than the other in the absence of stronger data, given that they are both leading stable democratic nations with similar public approval dynamics.",

Historical data shows that UK Prime Ministers often have volatile approval ratings due to the dynamic political environment in the UK. In contrast, Japanese Prime Ministers' approval ratings tend to be more stable, but often lower due to domestic political challenges. As of January 2025, Keir Starmer and Shiguru Ishiba's approval ratings were closely matched. Historically, the probability that significant changes in approval ratings occur within a short timeframe without major political events is low; thus, a rough historical base rate estimate could begin at 50% given the proximity of ratings at the last report.",

As of the last known data points from January 2025, both leaders' ratings should be considered, assuming they are both subject to domestic events that influence perception.

Historically, national leaders in stable democratic governments such as the UK and Japan have fluctuating approval ratings influenced by domestic and international events. Approval ratings in the UK have often been less stable compared to Japan's, given the UK's recent history of political and economic challenges, such as Brexit. In contrast, Japanese Prime Ministers have often enjoyed relatively stable approval ratings, though they are also subject to public perception changes based on policy and international relations. Considering these historical elements, an equal probability of the UK Prime Minister having a higher approval rating than the Japanese Prime Minister could be set around 50%, due to the absence of any major events causing drastic divergence in approval ratings.",

Historical data suggests that new leaders often experience a 'honeymoon' period shortly after taking office, during which approval ratings can be relatively high. However, mid-term ratings can vary significantly based on policy decisions and national context. Historically, Japanese Prime Ministers often face challenges in maintaining high approval ratings due to various political and economic factors. Assuming average approval ratings for a Prime Minister in their first year in office, we start with a base rate of close comparison probabilities. Typically, UK Prime Ministers in their first year since the 1970s have had approval ratings fluctuating around 40-50%, while Japanese counterparts often see a wider range from 30-50%, with frequent challenges to higher sustained ratings.

Historically, UK Prime Ministers often have fluctuating approval ratings due to the dynamic political environment in the UK, often ranging between 30% to 50%. Conversely, Japanese Prime Ministers have often maintained relatively steady approval ratings around a similar range, depending on economic conditions and political stability. Given that both countries often operate in similar approval ranges, a tie or slight lead for either is common. Therefore, I will start with a 50% probability for Keir Starmer having a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba.",

Initially, many experts estimated a higher probability for Starmer due to factors such as economic performance and diplomatic efforts. However, subsequent analysis following news updates revealed challenges for Starmer, including domestic policy criticisms and polls favoring other UK political figures. Conversely, Ishiba's approval ratings improved significantly, reaching 44%, supported by positive diplomatic engagements. Ultimately, experts adjusted their probabilities downward, with revised probabilities ranging from 5% to 65%, indicating a lower likelihood that Starmer would have a higher approval rating than Ishiba by April 1, 2025.",
