Despite the S&P 500's decline, Bessent remains confident in the recovery with good economic policies. The decline reflects concerns over Trump's measures, including tariffs and government cuts, which affect consumer confidence. According to Bessent, 'corre\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o normais e saud\u00e1veis' (corrections are normal and healthy).

Investors are evaluating whether the stock market has truly begun to recover or will continue to decline into a bear market. This week, they will face two major challenges: NVIDIA's GTC developer conference and the Federal Reserve's decision. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.6% on Friday, narrowing its weekly decline to 2.4%, while the S&P 500 Index rose 2.1%, narrowing its weekly decline to 2.3%. Both indices had their largest single-day gains since the day after the presidential election last year. Market concerns about the federal government shutdown have eased, and the lack of new variables in the Trump trade war has led to a strong rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 675 points on Friday, but still fell 3.1% for the week, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 3.3%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ADR rose 1.5%, with weekly declines of 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Analysts and investors are divided on whether the strong rebound is a sign of a trend reversal or just a further decline before the market stabilizes. Morgan Stanley Investment Management's fixed income chief, Kondouja, said, 'We don't think the market has bottomed out. Volatility will remain high, and there will be further downward space before policy clarity.' Yadeni, a well-known Wall Street strategist, said, 'Is it a dead cat bounce? As long as Trump doesn't talk about tariffs, it's a good day for the market. If the market can still rise when Trump talks about tariffs next time, then the market has truly bottomed out.' The Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday, with expectations of maintaining the interest rate unchanged. Paparadou, the head of multi-asset strategy at Morningstar Wealth, said, 'The market is trying to infer from various clues when the Fed will feel comfortable implementing the next rate cut.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 07:02 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/8610634)\n\n**Will the Market Experience a 'Scared-Cat Bounce' or a True Turnaround?**\nThe S&P 500 index, which had entered a technical correction, rebounded to its largest single-day gain since the US presidential election, with a 2.1% increase. The Nasdaq Composite Index also rose 2.6% on Friday, narrowing its weekly decline to 2.4%. The market's concerns about the federal government's shutdown have eased, and the lack of new variables in the Trump administration's trade war has led to a strong rebound. Even the decline in consumer confidence did not stop the momentum. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 675 points on Friday, with a 3.1% decline for the week, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 3.3% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's ADR rose 1.5%, with weekly declines of 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively. However, analysts and investors are divided on whether the rebound is a sign of a market turnaround or just a further decline. Vishal Khanduja, head of fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said, 'We don't think the market has bottomed out. Volatility will remain high, and before policy clarity, the market may have further room for downward movement.' Ed Yardeni, a well-known Wall Street strategist, said, 'Is it a scared-cat bounce? As long as Trump doesn't talk about tariffs, it's a good day for the market. If the market can rise when Trump talks about tariffs, we tend to think the market has truly bottomed out.' According to CFRA Research, the S&P 500 index has fallen to a correction in just 16 trading days. In the past 24 times the S&P 500 index has fallen at least 10% from its historical high but avoided a bear market, the average time to recover to its historical level was eight months. This means that the February 19 historical high may not be reached again until mid-October. The average decline in these 24 cases was 14%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 10:06 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/8610291)\n\n**US Stock Markets Recover Slightly at End of Dark Week**\nThe US stock markets have recovered slightly at the end of a dark week. Optimism was sparked on Friday by the hope that a feared government shutdown in the US can be avoided at the last minute. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued that a shutdown would only play into the hands of President Donald Trump, distracting from his agenda with the resulting chaos. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.65% to 41,488.19 points. For the week, this results in a minus of 3.1%. It is the largest weekly loss since March 2023. The S&P 500 index rose 2.13% to 5,638.94 points, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 gained 2.49% to 19,704.64 points. The markets had been unsettled worldwide by Trump's trade policy, and in the US, investors were put on high alert due to simultaneous concerns about the economy and inflation. The DZ Bank wrote that tangible progress on the tax cuts announced by the President is not visible. However, experts remain optimistic and believe in a better second half of the year. Their target for the S&P 500 is 6,300 points. According to BMO Wealth Management's Yung-Yu Ma, 'The markets are struggling with the question of where the fair value for a stock market lies, which is facing headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts, and potentially weakening economic data.' The current recovery was seen in all values from the group of the 'Magnificent 7', which are the most closely watched technology stocks in the US. The stocks of Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia gained between almost two and nearly six percent. However, this is not a stabilization, as the Nasdaq 100, dominated by these stocks, has already lost more than six percent in value this year. Positively noticeable in the tech sector were the stocks of Docusign, which shot up by almost 15 percent. The company, specialized in e-signature software, had exceeded expectations with its quarterly results and also presented a positive outlook for sales. According to Jefferies Research's Brent Thill, 'Encouraging results are paired with an attractive stock valuation.' \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[wallstreet-online.de](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/19115913-aktien-new-york-schluss-erholung-duesteren-woche)\n\n**S&P 500 Enters Correction Phase Amid Ongoing Uncertainty**\nThe S&P 500 has entered a correction phase after a turbulent trading day, with futures rising 0.81% on Friday morning, while the Nasdaq 100 futures increased by 1.05%. The Dow Jones futures also showed a slight recovery trend with a gain of 231 points (0.57%). The S&P 500 had a significant decline of 1.4% on Thursday, losing more than 10% since its last record high. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq Composite also suffered significant losses. The ongoing correction phase reflects the growing nervousness of investors, particularly due to the renewed uncertainties surrounding the US trade policy under President Donald Trump. The volatility and selling pressure have increased, resulting in all three major US indices losing more than 4% in the past week. If the downward trend continues, the Dow Jones may experience its second consecutive loss, the worst since June 2022. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq may also close their fourth consecutive week in the red. CNBC According to CNBC, Ray Dalio warned of global shocks through the US, and Whirlpool offers a top yield and 69 years of dividends. The focus is now on new economic data, particularly the consumer sentiment data scheduled for Friday morning, which may provide insights into consumer mood. The market is also awaiting the next Federal Reserve meeting next week, with a 98% probability of keeping interest rates unchanged, according to the FedWatch tool of the CME Group. It remains to be seen whether the recovery on Friday will be sustained or just a short-term relief before further losses. The uncertainty remains high, and the next few days will be crucial for the medium-term market development.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 07:25 AM\nSource:[wallstreet-online.de](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/19108230-us-aktienmarkt-s-p-500-rutscht-korrekturmodus-erholungsversuch-wochenausklang)\n\n**A 10% drop for stocks is scary, but isn't that rare**\nThe US stock market has dropped 10% from its high set last month due to concerns about the economy and a global trade war. This correction is not rare, as they occur every couple of years on average. Historically, corrections have been followed by a recovery, with the S&P 500 taking an average of 133 days to hit bottom and losing nearly 14% along the way. However, if the correction turns into a bear market, the damage can be much worse, with the average bear market lasting nearly 19 months and causing a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500. Investors are uncertain about what to expect, with some expecting Trump to pull back on policies if they prove too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain. The economy is still relatively solid, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns. As Stan Choe said, 'The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \u201cbear market,\u201d which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-correction-sp-wall-street-904910323785d377a7d61023df450b72)\n\n**US Stocks Face Uneven Recovery From Tariff-Triggered Correction**\nThe US stock market has fallen into a correction in just 16 trading days, with investors wondering how long the 'adjustment period' warned by the White House will last. According to CFRA Research data, in the past 24 instances where the stock market fell at least 10% from its record high but avoided a bear market, the average time to recover the historical high was 8 months, suggesting that the February 19 high point will remain until mid-October. The average drawdown in these 24 corrections was 14%. Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group LLC, believes that even if there is a short-term rebound, the market's pain may only just be beginning, citing the possibility that a sharp decline could lead to reduced spending by wealthy Americans, hindering economic growth. 'We think this correction is the first stage of a cyclical bear market,' Ramsey said. 'Therefore, we don't put too much effort into predicting what the recovery will look like.' The S&P 500 index rose over 1% in early trading on Friday, giving investors a glimmer of hope after a three-week decline and a 10% drop in just seven days. Before the latest decline, Trump escalated his conflict with the US's largest trading partner, reiterated his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and fired thousands of federal employees. 'The duration and depth of the sell-off are closely related to the question of whether an economic downturn or recession is about to occur,' said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management. 'If the economic slowdown is limited, or if there are policy 'put options' from the federal government or the Fed to prevent the market from free-falling, many 10-15% declines have quickly reversed.' Michael Hartnett of U.S. Bank predicted that the US stock market's rapid decline may prompt Trump and Fed officials to intervene, but so far, Trump and his advisors have given little reason for bulls to expect policy changes, particularly on trade. The US will impose tariffs on all countries with which it has trade relations on April 2, with economists warning that this will put pressure on prices. The Fed will release its latest policy decision on Wednesday, with investors betting that there will be no rate cut. Mayfield noted that the economic downturn is still limited, and policy uncertainty can be quickly corrected, but if tariff uncertainty persists and depresses consumer and business confidence, the stock market sell-off may be deeper and longer-lasting. The correct or incorrect assessment of an economic recession may be the key to whether investors suffer general losses or a major collapse. According to Baird's data, the average drawdown in non-recession periods has been 16%, while the stock market sell-off in recession periods has averaged a 36% decline. Since February 19, the S&P 500 index has lost around $500 billion in market value. The uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on economic growth and corporate profits, as well as inflation expectations, has already severely damaged the stock market, which had produced the best two-year performance since the 1990s internet bubble. Now, traders want to know how bad things will get. In the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 index fell 25% from its peak to its trough. If the same thing happens this year, the S&P 500 index would fall to around 4,700 points. The index closed at 5,521 points on Thursday. 'If we continue to be in this on-again, off-again tariff environment, businesses will be at a loss,' said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities. 'Furthermore, all the pessimism in the market is purely emotional, and the market needs to go through a behavioral adjustment phase before it can be prepared for a rally.' As the rebound becomes increasingly elusive, Wall Street institutions are also making adjustments. Goldman Sachs strategists have lowered their forecast for the S&P 500 index to reflect the past three weeks' decline. Even the outspoken bull Ed Yardeni has lowered his expectations for the index by around 9% and warned that the risk of stagflation triggered by tariffs has risen. The stock market's over-sold level has also reached a rare level. The S&P 500 index's relative strength index is currently at 27, below this level for less than 1% of the time in this century. While Leuthold Group's Ramsey calls this the first stage of a bear market, he says that 'the market has fallen enough to start a rebound of several percentage points at any time.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Fundstrat's Tom Lee, known for his bullish outlook, notes that the S&P 500's rapid decline into correction territory is similar to past episodes, such as the COVID-19 crash and the 2018 'volmageddon' event. Historically, stocks have recovered quickly from correction lows, with a median gain of 9% within three months and 15% within six months. However, it's worth noting that this is a small sample size and Lee's reputation as a 'permabull' may influence his analysis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Wilson believes the index may recover to 6,500 by year-end, but notes that the path will be 'volatile' and that a full-blown recession could lead to a 20% drop. Despite these concerns, some analysts are optimistic about certain tech and retail powerhouses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://qz.com/s-p-500-prediction-1h-2025-morgan-stanley-wilson-1851768794)\n\n**Morgan Stanley Strategist Warns of 5% S&P 500 Drop, 20% Recession Risk**\nMorgan Stanley's strategist, Wilson, predicts that the S&P 500 could drop by 5% before recovering to 6,500 points by the end of 2025. This implies a 13% increase from current levels. However, Wilson warns that the path to recovery will be volatile due to growth risks that could worsen before improving. He also notes that the index could fall by 20% in the event of a recession. Wilson attributes the recent decline in US stocks to concerns over valuation, particularly in the tech sector, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the impact of revised earnings estimates and the change in President Trump's stance on tariffs. Despite this, Wilson believes that seasonal patterns suggest that earnings revisions and S&P 500 performance may improve in the coming weeks. Trump has dismissed concerns over a recession, stating that the US economy is undergoing a 'period of transition' due to the significant changes being implemented. 'I hate predicting things like that,' Trump said. 'There's a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[Gesti\u00f3n](https://gestion.pe/mundo/eeuu/estratega-de-morgan-stanley-advierte-que-sp-500-podria-caer-un-5-noticia/)\n\n**S&P 500 to sink 5% on growth risks: Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson**\nMorgan Stanley's Michael Wilson predicts a 5% drop in the S&P 500 due to concerns over corporate earnings from tariffs and lower fiscal spending. He expects the index to hit a low of 5,500 points in the first half of the year, but recover to 6,500 by end-2025. Wilson warns that the benchmark could sink 20% in the event of a recession, but notes that the path to recovery will be volatile. He also suggests that seasonal patterns may improve earnings revisions and the S&P 500's performance over the next few weeks. 'The path is likely to be volatile as the market continues to contemplate these growth risks, which could get worse before they get better,' Wilson wrote.

However, experts point out that this is not the first time the market has experienced a significant decline. The S&P 500 has had larger drops, of 10% or more, each year. These drops are often seen as a correction of the optimism that can lead to overpriced stocks. Before this recent decline, many critics argued that the US stock market was overvalued after prices rose faster than corporate profits. Only a handful of companies were driving much of the market's returns, with seven large tech companies representing over half of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Historically, the S&P 500 has recovered from each of its declines, eventually allowing investors to recover their investment. This includes after global economic crises, the dot-com bubble, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Some recoveries take longer than others, but experts often recommend not investing money in stocks that cannot be afforded to lose for several years, up to ten. 'The data has shown, historically, that no one can predict the market,' said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. 'No one can consistently determine the best time to buy and sell.' 'Just keep going,' suggests Chris Fasciano, vice president of investment management and research, and chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. Despite the US stock market decline, some sectors outside of the 'Big Seven' have had much better performance, said Fasciano. Also, stocks outside of the US have performed well. This could be a reminder that investors often get better results when they have a diverse set of investments rather than betting on just a few. And investors may not be as diversified as they thought after years of the 'Big Seven' dominating the US stock market and Wall Street dominating global markets. 'Now is the time to review some of the old and proven principles of portfolio construction, such as diversification,' explained Fasciano. The proliferation of online trading platforms and the ease of smartphones have helped create a new generation of investors who may not be accustomed to such volatility. However, the good news is that younger investors often have the gift of time. With decades ahead until retirement, they can afford to surf the waves and let their stock portfolios recover, hopefully, before they accumulate and eventually grow even more. 'We would recommend that younger investors not worry about this at all,' said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management. 'It's just background noise. If you have 30 to 50 years until you need the money, the economy has survived world wars, oil embargoes, presidential assassinations, Y2K, and a pandemic. It will also survive Trump's tariffs.' This is a bit more complicated. 'In theory, part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies is that they are supposed to be a hedging investment that is not correlated with the stock market or the fiat currency economy,' argued Sam Taube, principal writer of investments for NerdWallet. But in reality, at least recently, cryptocurrencies have often fallen in price when stocks have fallen, rather than offering the expected protection during Wall Street sales. 'Therefore, young investors may need to rethink the idea that the value of cryptocurrencies is completely independent of the stock market and the economy in general,' said Taube. Older investors have less time than younger ones to allow their investments to recover. But even in retirement, some people may need their investments to last 30 years or more, said Niladri 'Neel' Mukherjee, director of investments at TIAA Wealth Management. People who have already retired may want to reduce spending and withdrawals after sharp market declines, because larger withdrawals will eliminate more potential accumulation capacity in the future. But even retirees, at least in the early part of retirement, should still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of expenses ahead. 'You may want to slow that down and increase it again once the market recovers,' said Mukherjee, 'but it all comes down to having that conversation with your advisor and your portfolio manager.' Nobody knows, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/finanzas/mercados-alterados-el-caos-arancelario-donald-trump-ocho-claves-surfear-la-elevada-volatilidad-n6120658)\n\n**If you're thinking about selling your stocks, you might want to think twice**\nThe recent 6% drop in the US stock market is not unusual, experts say. The S&P 500 has seen declines of 10% or more every year or so. Critics have been saying the US stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. A group of just seven Big Tech companies accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's total return last year. Experts advise not to sell and get out, as historically the S&P 500 has come back from every downturn to make investors whole again. They recommend not putting money into stocks that you can't afford to lose for several years, up to 10. Investors may want to revisit their portfolio construction, like diversification, and consider a mixed set of investments rather than going all-in on just a few. Younger investors can afford to ride the waves and let their stock portfolios recover before compounding and eventually growing even bigger. For those near retirement, it's recommended to cut back on spending and withdrawals after sharp market downturns, but still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of spending ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 05:16 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/investors-stock-market-wall-street-volatility-a8bb85c802be802929bda213253c8178)\n\n**Stock market today: Wall Street eases toward the end of its dreary February**\nWall Street is ending its dreary February on a positive note, with the S&P 500 up 0.6% in morning trading. The index had been on track to have its worst month since April, but a recent economic report showed encouraging trends. Despite this, the index has fallen in five of the last six days due to weaker-than-expected reports on the economy and concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs. The report also noted that the index had trimmed its loss for the month, which had been its worst since April. The article does not provide a clear explanation for the recent decline, but it suggests that the market is still recovering from the economic reports. The article also quotes a source as saying, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students.' However, this quote is not relevant to the article's content and seems to be an error. The correct quote is not provided in the article. The article does not provide any metrics or statistics that are relevant to the content. However, it does mention that the S&P 500 had fallen in five of the last six days, which is a relevant metric. The article's tone is neutral and objective, and it does not appear to be provocative. The reporting voice is also objective, and the article provides a clear and concise summary of the market's performance. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[The Sun Chronicle](https://www.thesunchronicle.com/business/stock-market-today-wall-street-eases-toward-the-end-of-its-dreary-february/article_b85c02c6-36ae-5c3a-8d2b-1b125160b774.html)\n\n**Economic Uncertainty May Stall S&P 500 Before Spring Rebound**\nAccording to Ilan Benhamou from JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index may experience stagnation in March due to weakening economic data, but he anticipates a rebound later in the spring. Benhamou notes that the market needs to reach a technically oversold level before recovery, and suggests that retail investors will be exhausted and commodity trading advisors will face financial constraints. However, he predicts that the S&P 500 will rise again by the end of March or early April, driven by improved liquidity, reduced macroeconomic uncertainty, and continued resilience in U.S. corporate earnings. In the mid-term, Benhamou is optimistic about the S&P 500's upward trajectory and expects yields to decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:56 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2719089/economic-uncertainty-may-stall-sp-500-before-spring-rebound)\n\n**US Stock Markets Fail to Recover from Recent Decline**\nUS stock markets failed to recover from their recent decline on the first trading day of the new week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 43,461.21 points, up 0.08% from the previous day. However, this was a minor gain after a 1.7% drop on Friday, which was the largest daily loss since mid-December. The S&P 500 index fell 0.50% to 5,983.25 points, the first time it has dropped below 6,000 points in nearly three weeks.

This made up for more than half of the index's drop from the previous day. The Nasdaq 100 had fallen by nearly 3% at the start of the week due to concerns over the high valuations of the US tech sector, sparked by a debate over potential competitive advantages of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.

Initial probabilities ranged from 30% to 80%, with most experts starting at around 50-60%, based on historical data of market recoveries following declines of similar magnitude. Factors influencing these probabilities included current economic indicators, market sentiment, geopolitical uncertainties, and potential policy interventions. In phase 2, after reviewing related news articles, most experts adjusted their probabilities slightly, with revised estimates spanning from 30% to 75%. The adjustments were influenced by recent market rebounds and expert opinions, but concerns about ongoing volatility, policy uncertainties, and potential further declines persisted, leading to cautious optimism among experts.",
