Boulder recorded a top speed of 84 mph on Monday morning, while Denver reached 56 mph early Wednesday morning. Pinpoint Weather Meteorologist Travis Michels said the wind warnings will end at noon, and the wind will slowly die down Wednesday afternoon and into the sunset hours. Michels noted that the Denver metro area should not be windy heading into Thursday, but the Eastern Plains will still see strong winds through the end of the week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 07:22 PM\nSource:[FOX21 News](https://www.fox21news.com/news/these-colorado-areas-saw-80-mph-wind-gusts-after-a-breezy-start-to-the-week/)\n\n**2024: The First Year to Exceed 1.5 Degrees Celsius Above Pre-Industrial Levels**\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2024 was the first year that the Earth's average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This marks the first time the '1.5 degree' threshold, set as a target to mitigate the effects of climate change, has been surpassed. However, the long-term trend shows that the Earth's temperature increase is still within the 1.5 degree limit, and global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are urgently needed. The WMO's latest climate report reveals that last year's global average temperature was 1.55 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, making it the hottest year on record in 175 years. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a record high, with carbon dioxide levels at 420.0 PPM, a 151% increase from 1750. Methane and nitrous oxide levels also reached their highest levels in 80,000 years. The rate of ocean warming is also accelerating, with the total ocean heat content reaching a record high in 2023. Sea levels are rising rapidly, with the average sea level height reaching a record high in 2024. Glaciers are also melting at an alarming rate, with the largest decline in glacier mass occurring between 2022 and 2024. The Arctic sea ice area was the smallest in 18 years, and the Antarctic sea ice area has been below 20 million square kilometers for three consecutive years. However, the WMO notes that this one-year exceedance of 1.5 degrees does not necessarily mean that the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree limit has been failed. The long-term trend shows that the Earth's temperature increase is still within the 1.5 degree limit, with a projected range of 1.34-1.41 degrees Celsius.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202503192134015)\n\n**On Today's Date: The Epic Denver, Colorado, Blizzard Of 2003**\nOn March 19, 2003, a massive snowstorm hit Denver, Colorado, and the surrounding areas, dumping 20-40 inches of snow in the Front Range corridor and 3-7 feet of snow in the foothills. The storm caused widespread disruptions, with most interstates and local roads shut down due to deep snow or avalanches. The Denver International Airport's roof suffered a 40-foot gash, and at least 258 structures were damaged due to roof collapses or failures. The storm left 135,000 without power for several days, making it Denver's second heaviest snowstorm in recorded history. According to Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist at weather.com, March is Denver's snowiest month on average, and this storm remains one of the most significant snow events in the area's history.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/todays-date-epic-denver-colorado-100000536.html)\n\n**Mauna Kea: The Mountain That Surpasses Everest**\nA scientist, Alexander Osadchii, has disputed the common notion that Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth. According to Osadchii, Mount Mauna Kea, located on the Hawaiian Islands, is actually the highest mountain, surpassing Everest by over 2,000 meters. Mauna Kea stands at 4,200 meters above sea level, but its base is mostly underwater, and its total height from its base to its summit is approximately 10,200 meters, which is higher than Everest's summit by over 2,000 meters. Osadchii explained that the Hawaiian Islands were formed by a mantle plume, a hot flow of magma from the Earth's core that rises hundreds of kilometers and creates new volcanic hotspots. As magma flows out of the ocean floor, it can form an island on the surface. The Hawaiian Islands were formed around half a million years ago, and a new volcano, Loihi, is currently growing near Mauna Kea, which has already reached a height of over 1,000 meters, Osadchii said in his Telegram channel. Interestingly, scientists have previously found microplastic particles on the summit of Everest, which they believe may have come from alpinists and their equipment. The particles were found in the 'death zone,' an area above 8,000 meters above sea level.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430](https://vm.ru/news/1214606-uchenyj-osadchiev-nazval-goru-kotoraya-okazalas-vyshe-everesta)\n\n**Colorado's Copper Mountain plans large expansion, new lifts, and highest chairlift in North America**\nCopper Mountain in Colorado has announced plans to expand its skiable areas, build new lifts, and upgrade existing ones. The expansion, which could add 500 acres of skiable terrain, aims to reduce lift lines by allowing quicker and more efficient transportation. The Master Plan also includes building a Jaques East lift to access Jaques Peak, which would become the highest lift in North America, surpassing Breckenridge's current record. According to President/GM Dustin Lyman, 'Certainly, putting a chairlift above 13,000 feet, there's only a few places that you can do that,' and 'Right here in Summit County is one of those places.' Lyman emphasized the importance of considering environmental impact and sustainability, stating, 'We've got to make sure that we pay attention to the environmental impact and we have as small of a footprint as possible.' He also acknowledged the logistical challenges of the project, saying, 'Just logistically, getting back into that terrain is complicated. There's not roads that go back in there. There's not electricity or any of that type of infrastructure.' Lyman added, 'It certainly won't be next season,' indicating that the project's timeline is uncertain and may change.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 01:18 AM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-copper-mountain-expansion-ski-area-lifts/)\n\n**Snow, rain and more wind expected in Colorado, some areas on Eastern Plains will be under a blizzard warning**\nA mixed bag of weather is expected in Colorado, with rain and snow developing across the Front Range and Eastern Plains on Tuesday night.

A strong area of low pressure on February 14-15 will deliver heavy snow accumulation to all mountain zones, with potentially 1-3 feet of total accumulation. As one meteorologist might say, 'The green (moisture) over Denver, Front Range, Foothills, and Central & Northern Mountain zones on Wednesday, February 12, indicates a high likelihood of snowfall in these areas.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[weathernationtv.com](https://www.weathernationtv.com/news/snowy-period-ahead-for-colorado)\n\n**Colorado weather: Near record heat forecast ahead of cold front**\nDenver is forecast to see near-record heat on Monday, with temperatures potentially reaching 70 degrees, which would tie the record high for February 3 set in 1954. Even if the record is not broken, temperatures will still be nearly 30 degrees above normal for this time of month. The Foothills and part of the Eastern Plains are also expected to see near-record heat, with Golden forecast to break its current record by more than 10 degrees, reaching 67 degrees. However, cities further east, such as Limon and Crook, are expected to see temperatures well below the record and closer to the average.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[The Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/03/colorado-weather-near-record-heat-february-cold-front/)\n\n**Weather | Colorado snow totals for Jan. 30, 2025**\nThe National Weather Service reported the following Colorado snow totals for January 30, 2025: The highest snowfall was in Cuchara with 14.5 inches, while the lowest was in several locations with 0.1 inch.

    "summary": "After evaluating historical temperature data and recent weather patterns, the experts generally predicted that there is a high likelihood of the highest high in Denver, Colorado, exceeding the lowest low in Honolulu, Hawaii, before April 1, 2025. Initial probabilities ranged from 10% to 90% across experts, with the majority estimating a probability between 70% and 90%. Following phase 2, where experts were presented with recent news articles, the revised probabilities largely remained in the same range, with minor adjustments. The final revised probabilities ranged from 20% to 95%, with most experts maintaining or slightly decreasing their initial estimates due to forecasts of wintry patterns in Denver, potentially limiting temperature spikes. Overall, the consensus leaned towards a high probability of the event occurring.",
