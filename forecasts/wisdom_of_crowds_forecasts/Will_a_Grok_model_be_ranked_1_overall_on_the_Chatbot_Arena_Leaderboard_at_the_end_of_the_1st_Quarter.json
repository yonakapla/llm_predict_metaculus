The researchers queried eight chatbots with article excerpts and found that they returned wrong answers to over 60% of the queries. The chatbots, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, 'returned wrong answers with alarming confidence,' tending not to qualify their results or admit to knowledge gaps. Even premium models like Grok-3 Search and Perplexity Pro answered more correctly than free versions, but still gave wrong answers more confidently. The report concludes that AI tools mis-crediting sources or incorrectly representing their work could backfire on the publishers' reputations and that original reporting is still a more reliable news source than what AI tools regurgitate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/even-premium-ai-tools-distort-the-news-and-fabricate-links-these-are-the-worst/)\n\n**Google Releases Gemma 3 Series of Models, a Single-GPU Model with High Performance**\nGoogle has released the Gemma 3 series of models, which are the most advanced, portable, and responsible open-source models developed by Google.

The model's advantages include its ability to run directly on mobile phones, PCs, and workstations, with parameter sizes of 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B. Developers can choose the parameter size based on their specific hardware and performance requirements. In the initial human preference evaluation on the LMArena leaderboard, Gemma 3 outperformed Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3, and o3-mini. Google has also released a 4B-parameter image safety classifier called ShieldGemma 2, which can be used to filter image inputs and outputs to detect explicit, violent, or dangerous content. Google has also provided a quantized version of the model, which can run on a single GPU, unlike other models that may require up to 32 GPUs. According to the Chatbot Arena Elo score ranking, Gemma 3-27B has a high score, indicating that it is highly favored by users. The model's paper mentions that all models were evaluated by human scorers in a blind and parallel manner, and each model received an Elo score. Gemma-3-27B-IT scored higher than DeepSeek-V3 and o3-preview in the initial human preference evaluation on the LMArena leaderboard. Gemma 3 supports over 35 languages out of the box and provides pre-trained support for over 140 languages. It can also help developers create AI functions with advanced text and visual reasoning capabilities, such as image, text, and short video analysis applications. Gemma 3 supports function calls and structured output, enabling developers to automate tasks and build agents. Google has also released a 4B-parameter image safety classifier called ShieldGemma 2, which can be used to filter image inputs and outputs to detect explicit, violent, or dangerous content. The model's training data includes a larger token budget than Gemma 2, with 14T tokens used for the 27B version, 12T tokens used for the 12B version, 4T tokens used for the 4B version, and 2T tokens used for the 1B version. The model also uses a SentencePiece Tokenizer with 262k entries, which is more balanced for non-English languages. Gemma 3 uses filtering techniques to reduce unnecessary or unsafe speech risks and delete certain personal information and other sensitive data. The model's development tools include Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama, JAX, Keras, PyTorch, Google AI Edge, UnSloth, vLLM, and Gemma.cpp. Developers can access Gemma 3 in Google AI Studio or download the model through Kaggle or Hugging Face.

According to NewsGuard, the Russian network 'Pravda' published over 3.6 million articles in 2024, which were integrated into large AI models such as ChatGPT, Grok from xAI, and Microsoft Copilot. The study found that in 33.55% of cases, AI chatbots repeated the information, in 48.22% of cases they denied it, and in 18.22% of cases they avoided a specific answer. NewsGuard accused 'Pravda' of intentionally inserting false facts to mislead AI, which draws information in real-time. The company made this conclusion after finding that several chatbots repeated a false claim about the ban of Truth Social in Ukraine, although the platform was never launched there. Six out of ten chatbots accepted this claim as a fact and even cited articles from 'Pravda'. This raises serious concerns about the accuracy of information and its presentation. People increasingly rely on AI summaries, which do not always correctly verify facts, creating a risk of manipulating public opinion, considering the influence of AI model owners.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:36 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/52e9bb3c)\n\n**Grok 3: The Future of AI Chatbots or Just Another Hype?**\nGrok 3, developed by xAI, is a strong competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
