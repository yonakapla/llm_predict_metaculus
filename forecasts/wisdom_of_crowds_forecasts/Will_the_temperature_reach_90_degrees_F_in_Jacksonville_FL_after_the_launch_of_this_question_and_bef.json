A brush fire in southern Miami-Dade has forced the closure of Card Sound Road, and the wind will play a role in determining where the smoke will move. Rain is not expected to help with the containment of the fire, and it will be mainly dry and sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 80s. There is a moderate risk of rip currents along the Atlantic beaches. Thursday will be the warmest day of the week, with highs in the mid 80s, but it will be breezy.

'The temperature will be above 10 degrees Celsius on March 23 and 24, with daytime temperatures ranging from +6 to +11 degrees Celsius. It will be sunny due to high pressure, and the air masses will be moving from the south,' Vilfand said. He added that on March 25, daytime temperatures are expected to range from +9 to +14 degrees Celsius, with mostly clear skies and little precipitation. 'There will be plenty of sunshine in the coming days, and if you stand outside for an hour, you might even get a sunburn,' Vilfand concluded. This comes after Tatyana Pozdnyakova, the chief specialist at the Moscow Meteorological Bureau, predicted that April will be 3 degrees warmer than normal in Moscow. Vilfand also previously stated that spring 2025 temperatures will be within or slightly below normal, and that the winter of 2024-2025 was the second warmest on record.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1856652/2025-03-19/vilfand-sprognoziroval-do-14-gradusov-tepla-v-moskve-na-sleduiushchei-nedele)\n\n**Russia's April Weather Forecast: Warmer Than Usual**\nAccording to a forecast by Moscow's meteorological office, temperatures in the Central Federal District (CFO) are expected to be three degrees warmer than usual.

This means that the mean monthly temperature will exceed +10\u00b0C,' she wrote in her Telegram channel. Podynyakova notes that April this year will be similar to April 2024 in terms of temperature. However, the forecast for precipitation is uncertain, with both a deficit and an excess being equally likely. Last year, April saw an excess of precipitation, with 37 mm of normal precipitation exceeded by 130-150%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/03/19/reg-cfo/sinoptik-pozdniakova-v-aprele-anomalno-teplaia-pogoda-v-moskve-sohranitsia.html)\n\n**Dante Ricci: Cold returns after taste of spring**\nPutnam County can expect a cold return after a taste of spring, with gusty north winds and chances of snow showers on Thursday.

Jung says that it will be unusually warm for the season, with temperatures in the west and southwest reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius, and locally even warmer. In the east, temperatures will reach up to 21 degrees Celsius, and in the north, up to 18 degrees Celsius. Jung also notes that the sun will shine brightly throughout the country, with 10-12 hours of sunshine per day. However, a high-pressure system called 'Konstantina' will bring Saharan dust to the country, which may cloud the sky in the west on Friday. Despite this, temperatures are expected to remain warm over the weekend, with values of 15-22 degrees Celsius predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Jung notes that it is still unclear how the weather will develop in April and May, and that cold air masses may still occur.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[T-online.de](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/wetter/id_100641434/wetter-bis-zu-25-grad-diese-woche-erster-sommertag-moeglich.html)\n\n**Tomsk to Experience a Short Warmth Before a Cold Snap**\nAccording to Gismeteo, Tomsk can expect temperatures to rise to +10 degrees Celsius on March 19-20, 2025, with the air warming up to 16:00.

This will lead to an early awakening of nature and infrastructure in the region. While the early warmth brings pleasant prospects, it may also have negative consequences, such as early tree blooming, which can cause problems for people with allergies, and an increase in forest fires due to dry soil. However, for gardeners, this will be a welcome gift, as the long-awaited dacha season will start much earlier. For people with weather-related health issues, the rapid temperature fluctuations may pose a significant challenge. As a result, it is essential to be prepared for the unusual consequences of this early summer.

'We'll see highs in the 50s by Sunday, so that's a nice change of pace.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 10:52 AM\nSource:[wokv.com](https://www.wokv.com/news/local/first-alert-weather-cold-mornings-continue-gradual-warming-trend-view/GWZDFQRKA5E4NDN25HXGW6QD6I/)\n\n",

Based on climate data, Jacksonville typically experiences temperatures reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit or higher predominantly in late spring and summer months. Historical records from the National Weather Service show that the probability of reaching 90 degrees or higher in Jacksonville this early in the year is relatively low, as such temperatures are not common in late March. Using data from past years, the chance of hitting this temperature threshold between March 24 and March 31 has generally been around 10-20%. For the purposes of this forecast, I'll set the initial base rate at 15%.",

    "summary": "After reviewing historical weather patterns and current climate trends, the experts initially estimated a low probability of temperatures reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Jacksonville, FL, between March 24 and April 1, 2025. Initial probabilities ranged from 5% to 35% across different experts, with common factors like climate change and seasonal variability slightly increasing these probabilities in some analyses. In phase 2, after evaluating recent weather forecasts indicating a warming trend but with predicted highs mostly in the 80s, most experts maintained or slightly increased their probabilities. Revised probabilities ranged from 10% to 50%, with many experts concluding that while warmer temperatures are possible, reaching the 90-degree threshold remains unlikely within the specified timeframe.",
