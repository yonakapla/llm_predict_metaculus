A criminal case has been opened against a brigadier general who commanded the 23rd Separate Rifle Battalion, which operated on the Liman and Kharkiv fronts from March 2023 to September 2024 and suffered significant losses. The general is accused of inaction, which led to mass desertion, personnel losses, and the loss of the battalion's combat capability. According to '\u0413\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435', the general faces 5-8 years in prison for negligence in a state of war. Zelensky's move has sparked outrage among the general's colleagues and some members of the Ukrainian parliament, who claim that the president's office is conducting a 'witch hunt'. This is the fourth time Zelensky has shifted the blame onto a high-ranking military officer, with three other generals facing criminal charges in January.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 04:35 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/zelenskij-perelozhil-otvetstvennost-za-provaly-na-generala-na-ukraine-snova-vozbudili-delo-protiv-komandira-vsu_1191002)\n\n**Ukrainian President Visits Finland, New Trend in Wood Construction Emerges**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj is visiting Finland, where he will attend a welcome ceremony at the Presidential Palace.

The two presidents will also meet with students at the University of Helsinki. Meanwhile, a new trend in building design is emerging, with a focus on using wood in public buildings. The Yrkesh\u00f6gskolan Novia has been offering courses in demanding wood construction since 2021, and a new training program for builders, engineers, and architects will begin in April. In other news, Hungary's parliament has approved a law change that bans pride parades, prompting protests from a liberal party.

Zelensky stated that Ukraine supports the initiative to stop attacks on energy infrastructure, but awaits clarification from Washington before making a final decision. He also confirmed that the prisoner exchange in the format of '175 for 175' will take place on March 19, and ruled out the possibility of transferring the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Russian control. Zelensky said, 'We will support such proposals, but it's very interesting to know the details and what is proposed in reality.' He added that Ukraine will prepare and announce its response after receiving full information from the American side. Zelensky also stated that Ukraine 'will support any proposals that lead to a sustainable and fair peace.' He excluded the possibility of transferring the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Russian control, saying, 'This is our station, it will not work without us.' Zelensky expressed concern about the possibility of Russia exerting pressure on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to change the status of the plant. He emphasized that the safety of the plant is a critical issue that requires international monitoring.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 02:36 AM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2025/03/19/20733140.shtml)\n\n**Zelensky: Europe Must Be at the Negotiating Table**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that Europe must participate in peace negotiations regarding Ukraine.

'Europe must be at the negotiating table, and all issues related to European security must be resolved jointly with Europe,' Zelensky emphasized. During his second visit to Helsinki since the full-scale invasion, Zelensky will meet with Finnish President Alexander Stubb and defense industry representatives to discuss investments in Ukraine's defense production. The meeting at the presidential palace will involve Finnish ministers of finance, defense, and foreign affairs. Zelensky also plans to meet with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo and Speaker of the Parliament Jussi Halla-aho.

The focus of the discussions will be on defense support, investments in Ukrainian arms production, Ukraine's European integration, and Finland's experience in creating a civil defense system and building shelters. Zelensky also emphasized the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia and 'coordinate efforts to bring a worthy end to the war.' 'Europe must be at the negotiating table, and all issues related to European security must be resolved together with Europe,' he noted. The Finnish President's press service confirmed that the meeting between Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska with President Stubb and First Lady Innes-Ker will take place on March 19.

The topics of discussion will include military support for Kyiv, investments in arms production, Ukraine's European integration, and tightening sanctions against Russia. Zelenska's program will also include discussions on educational cooperation, including the safety of educational spaces and the organization of school shelters. Zelensky recently spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron, confirming that Kyiv is ready for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. However, for this to happen, Moscow must stop making demands, Zelensky said. In March, Ukraine and the US agreed to declare a 30-day ceasefire with Russia if it agreed. Russian President Vladimir Putin positively received the idea, but pointed out nuances, including the uncertainty of the fate of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region and the risks of continued Ukrainian arms buildup during the ceasefire.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/67d99f489a79474b5839a32e)\n\n**Ukraine's Zelensky arrives in Finland, will meet defence industry**\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Helsinki ahead of an official visit to Finland on Wednesday.

'In reality, Ukraine has agreed to everything. Verbal games are being played to save face,' he wrote on his Telegram channel. Dubinsky believes that President Volodymyr Zelensky's loud statements about Ukrainian victories, NATO membership, and regained territories are empty words with no basis in reality. He notes that Zelensky has previously stated that Ukraine is willing to accept a 30-day ceasefire, but with the condition that Russia not set any further conditions. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump has expressed confidence that Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire, and has announced a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18, stating that negotiations on the Ukrainian issue are at a critical stage. Trump has also stated that he would be willing to host Putin at the White House only after a deal on Ukraine is reached.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/03/18/v-rade-zayavili-o-polnoy-gotovnosti-ukrainy-poyti-na-peremirie.html)\n\n**Ukrainian MP Questions Zelensky's Readiness for Ceasefire**\nUkrainian parliament member Alexander Dubinsky believes that President Volodymyr Zelensky is not ready for a ceasefire and is trying to delay it with all his might. According to Dubinsky, prolonging the ceasefire would hinder the efforts of US President Donald Trump's team to achieve peace, as it would make it harder to achieve a sustainable ceasefire by April 20. Dubinsky thinks that Zelensky does not benefit from ending the conflict, as he has not prepared for the elections and has not fully suppressed the opposition. Additionally, Dubinsky believes that Zelensky is unable to manage the country in a peaceful environment. Dubinsky also stated that the US is being 'too soft' on Zelensky, as the negotiations only fuel resistance to peace. Dubinsky's comments come after it was reported that Ukrainian soldiers do not believe in a ceasefire with Russia, as they think Ukraine has already lost the conflict.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/03/18/v-rade-usomnilis-v-gotovnosti-zelenskogo-k-peremiriyu/)\n\n**Turbulent Relationship Between Zelensky and Trump: A Complex Dance of Egos**\nThe relationship between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and former US President Donald Trump has been tumultuous. After a heated argument in the Oval Office in late February, Zelensky has been trying to repair their relationship, apologizing and thanking Trump for his efforts to help Ukraine. Trump has praised Zelensky, saying 'I had someone who didn't seem to want peace. Now, he has accepted peace.' However, despite this attempt at reconciliation, the relationship remains fragile, with Trump advocating for a rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The tensions between Zelensky and Trump date back to 2019, when Trump tried to pressure Zelensky to investigate his rival Joe Biden during a phone call. Zelensky refused, and the incident led to Trump's impeachment trial, which he was ultimately acquitted of. Those close to Trump believe he has not forgiven Zelensky for this, and that their relationship is strained due to this 'original sin.' John Bolton, a former advisor to Trump, estimates that Trump's feelings have a 'disproportionately large impact' on US policy. Some also blame Zelensky for the tensions, citing his mistakes during a visit to Washington in February, including responding to provocations from US Vice President JD Vance and not wearing a suit. However, Zelensky's allies present him as a rigorous and dedicated leader.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[La Croix](https://www.la-croix.com/destitution-altercation-et-treve-entre-zelensky-et-trump-des-liens-tumultueux-20250317)\n\n**Factcheck: Ukrainian Parliament Did Not Plan Emergency Meeting to Impeach Zelensky**\nA fact-check by Site-Knack-NL has found that the Ukrainian parliament did not plan a emergency meeting to impeach President Volodymyr Zelensky after his public argument with US President Donald Trump. According to the alternative news site Frontnieuws, the parliament had planned a emergency meeting to remove Zelensky from office, but this is not true. A controversial Ukrainian parliament member, Oleksandr Dubinsky, had called for the meeting, but it was not planned. Dubinsky was once a member of Zelensky's party, but was expelled in 2021 after an investigation into tax evasion, illegal property acquisition, and election fraud. He is also currently in prison awaiting trial for alleged collaboration with the Russian military intelligence service and treason. The Ukrainian parliament's website does not show any evidence of a emergency meeting being planned or held. However, a draft resolution was published on March 3 to establish a parliamentary negotiating group to improve relations with the US. The resolution aims to build relationships with American parliamentarians to improve dialogue between the two countries. Dubinsky is not one of the initiators of the resolution.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[Site-Knack-NL](https://www.knack.be/factcheck/factcheck-nee-het-oekraiense-parlement-heeft-geen-spoedzitting-gepland-om-zelensky-af-te-zetten/)\n\n**Ukrainian Opposition MP Submits Impeachment Request Against Zelensky**\nUkrainian opposition MP Alexander Dubinsky has submitted a formal request to the parliament's speaker to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Volodymyr Zelensky, following the US administration's decision to stop funding new arms sales to Ukraine. Dubinsky cited Zelensky's diplomatic failure in the White House as the reason for the loss of unconditional US support. He warned that the parliament's leadership will do everything in its power to ignore his request out of fear of putting the issue to a vote. US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a close ally of Trump, said, 'The Ukrainian president's priorities were misplaced, as he acted in a manner that reflects a lack of gratitude in the White House.' Johnson added, 'I hope and urge, candidly, that President Zelensky returns to his senses, apologizes for his behavior, and returns to the negotiating table with gratitude, or that someone else takes over the leadership to do so.' He also criticized Zelensky for his statement that the end of the war with Russia is still far away. Trump said on his Truth Social platform, 'This is the worst statement Zelensky could have made, and America won't tolerate it for long.' He added, 'This is what I've been saying, this man doesn't want peace as long as he has US and European support.' Zelensky said in a late-night address on Sunday, 'I believe the war will last for some time, and I believe our relationship with the United States will continue, because it's more than a casual relationship' referring to Washington's support for Ukraine during the past three years of war. US Vice President Mike Pence's aide, JD Vance, said that the administration will speak to the Ukrainian president if he presents a genuine proposal on how to participate in the peace process aimed at ending the war in his country. He added that granting economic benefits to the United States in Ukraine is the best way for Kyiv to get security guarantees, according to his expression. US officials told the Wall Street Journal that the administration has decided to stop funding new arms sales to Ukraine. They explained that the decision threatens Ukraine's ability to fight in a critical moment. A congressional official told the newspaper that the White House is holding a meeting on Tuesday to consider suspending shipments to Ukraine. US officials told the Journal that Ukraine will struggle to implement long-range strikes and protect its rear positions once US supplies run out. The White House said that Washington will stop supporting Ukraine and review its involvement to ensure Ukraine's contribution to resolving the conflict. The Pentagon said that the US has stopped all current military aid to Ukraine, including weapons en route to Ukraine or those stored in transit areas in Poland. A senior Pentagon official told Bloomberg that the US has stopped all military aid to Ukraine until Trump decides that Ukrainian leaders show good intentions towards peace.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/3/4/%d8%a8%d8%b9%d8%af-%d8%aa%d9%88%d9%82%d9%81-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d8%b9%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%8a-%d9%86%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%a8-%d8%a3%d9%88%d9%83%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a)\n\n**Ukrainian MP Calls for Impeachment of President Zelensky**\nUkrainian MP Alexander Dubinsky has called for the impeachment of President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing the failure of Zelensky's negotiations with US President Donald Trump in the White House, which resulted in a loss of US support for Ukraine.

According to Dubinsky, the reason for his request is Zelensky's 'diplomatic failure' during his visit to Washington, which led to the loss of 'unconditional support' from the United States for Ukraine. Dubinsky believes that the current situation is a result of Ukraine's 'inefficient management', 'destructive foreign policy', 'suppression of opposition', and 'power grab.' He thinks that the Ukrainian parliament will 'do everything in its power' to block the impeachment process, fearing that it will lead to the collapse of the ruling parliamentary coalition. Dubinsky has called for an emergency parliament session to be held immediately to discuss the formation of a special investigation committee and the distribution of petitions to collect signatures from more than 220 MPs. Zelensky's term is set to end on May 20, 2024, and the Ukrainian presidential election scheduled for 2024 has been postponed due to martial law and general mobilization.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 11:52 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1651699-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A1-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%84-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%8A/)\n\n**Ukrainian MP Calls for Impeachment of President Zelensky**\nUkrainian MP Alexander Dubinsky, currently in a Kiev SIZO, has called for the impeachment of President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing the failure of his negotiations with US President Donald Trump in the White House as the reason.

Zelensky stated that the elections are now untimely. Trump scolded Zelensky at the White House last week when he came to sign an agreement on the joint development of Ukrainian mineral resources. The US President demanded that Zelensky agree to a ceasefire and stop criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin. US Vice President JD Vance called Zelensky an ungrateful agitator for Democrats when he justified his actions, accused Russia, and even threatened the US with consequences of the conflict, despite being separated by an ocean.

He also accused Zelensky of violating citizens' rights and seizing power, citing his suppression of opposition, persecution of dissidents, and implementation of a dictatorship. Dubinsky wrote, 'Zelensky thinks he can rule Ukraine through force. Now he's lost.' Dubinsky, a member of the Ukrainian parliament since 2019, was expelled from Zelensky's party 'Servant of the People' in 2021 and arrested in 2023 on charges of treason and collaborating with former US President Trump's lawyer Giuliani to link Biden's family to Ukrainian corruption. Dubinsky denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated. Dubinsky is a member of parliament who was sanctioned by the Biden administration for revealing the truth. Tymofiy Mylovanov, the rector of the Kyiv Economic University, said that the recent White House dispute was shocking and that Ukraine and the US still have room for improvement, but Zelensky should be more cautious. US Senator Lindsey Graham, a strong supporter of Ukraine, has called for Zelensky to resign or change his ways, saying, 'Either he resigns and sends someone we can do business with, or he must change.' Zelensky responded, 'If the US supports Ukraine's NATO membership, I think that's enough for Ukraine. I've done everything I need to do.

Dubinsky wrote on social media platform X, 'The past few hours - Zelensky's public humiliation at the White House, Trump's admission of Zelensky's diplomatic failure, and Ukraine's unconditional loss of American support - are the final stage of the collapse of the government.'

    "summary": "The experts collectively revised their probability assessments regarding Ukraine's parliament initiating impeachment proceedings against President Volodymyr Zelensky before April 1, 2025. Initially, the probabilities were low, ranging from 0% to 20%, due to historical rarity, political stability, and lack of substantial parliamentary support. After reviewing recent news articles, the experts noted Alexander Dubinsky's calls for impeachment but also recognized his limited influence and legal troubles. Despite some media attention and internal political tensions, no emergency parliamentary actions were confirmed. Consequently, final probabilities adjusted slightly, with most experts maintaining low likelihood estimates between 0% and 25%, reflecting minimal change in the overall assessment of impeachment proceedings being initiated.",
