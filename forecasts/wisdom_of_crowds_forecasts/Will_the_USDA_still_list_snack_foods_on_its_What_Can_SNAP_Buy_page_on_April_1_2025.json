The bill, which passed 31-19, aims to reduce childhood obesity rates and includes education strategies on healthy food options. Supporters, such as State Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, argue that the bill is not against low-income individuals, but rather against the marketing of processed foods to children. Critics, like State Sen. Sara Novak, believe that it is a parent's responsibility to regulate what their kids eat and drink. The bill requires a waiver from the USDA, and if denied, the state must resubmit the request annually until approval is granted.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[NBC Montana](https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/montana-senate-gives-approval-to-bill-prohibiting-snap-purchases-of-soft-drinks-candy)\n\n**Food Stamps: 4 Major Changes to SNAP in 2025**\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is making changes in 2025. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP reduces food insecurity by up to 30% and is more effective among children. The USDA adjusts SNAP maximum allotments, deductions, and income eligibility standards at the beginning of each federal fiscal year. In 2025, the age limit for 'able-bodied adults without dependents' (ABAWD) work requirements has increased to 52, and will expand to 54 by October 2024. Exemptions to the ABAWD work requirements include physical or mental limitations, pregnancy, veteran status, homelessness, and being 24 or younger and in foster care. SNAP benefits are available to those who do not exceed 130% of the federal poverty level. Maximum allotments for SNAP in the 48 contiguous states and D.C. are available on the USDA website.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/food-stamps-4-major-changes-120021102.html)\n\n**USDA Announces Approval of D-SNAP for Kentucky Disaster Areas**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced the approval of the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) for 14 counties in Kentucky affected by recent severe storms, flooding, and straight-line winds. Approximately 12,600 households are estimated to be eligible for this relief to help with grocery expenses. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said, 'USDA is dedicated to helping individuals and families in Kentucky as they grapple with the aftermath of recent storms and flooding.' Eligible counties include Breathitt, Clay, Estill, Floyd, Harlan, Johnson, Knott, Lee, Letcher, Martin, Owsley, Perry, Pike, and Simpson. The D-SNAP application will be available from March 5 to March 7, 2025. Eligible households will receive one month of benefits equal to the maximum monthly amount for a SNAP household of their size.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/05/usda-announces-approval-d-snap-kentucky-disaster-areas)\n\n**SNAP benefits could change for 100,000 Americans**\nLawmakers in Idaho are pushing to restrict what Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries can buy with their benefits, with a bill that could exclude candy and soda from the list of eligible foods. If passed, the legislation could affect tens of thousands of beneficiaries, with 130,900 Idaho residents currently collecting monthly SNAP benefits. According to Representative Josh Brecheen, 'If someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that's up to them. But what we're saying is, don't ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.' However, critics argue that targeting soda and candy while leaving other sugary foods, such as flavored yogurt and granola bars, untouched is unfair. As Valerie Imbruce, the director of the Center for Environment and Society at Washington College, said, 'Sugar is found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Not just in soda and candy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 12:03 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/snap-benefits-change-junk-food-candy-idaho-2039766)\n\n**The uncertain future of SNAP benefits**\nThe future of SNAP benefits is uncertain as Republican lawmakers work to make budget cuts and limit what can be purchased using the anti-hunger benefits. According to Ivy Enoch, SNAP policy and training lead at Hunger Free Vermont, 'Everyone currently participating in SNAP is at risk of losing some or all of their benefits.' The House of Representatives has passed a budget that directs the House Committee on Agriculture to cut programs spending in its jurisdiction by at least $230 billion through to 2034, with a significant chunk of the cuts expected to come from SNAP. Republicans are also pushing for state-level efforts to restrict 'junk' food purchases using SNAP benefits, citing concerns about taxpayers bearing the financial burden of health issues stemming from diet-related conditions.

This delay will allow the FDA to review questions of fact, law, and policy raised by the rules. According to the memo, the FDA will consider opening a comment period to allow interested parties to provide comments about issues of fact, law, and policy. The FDA requires that food products meet certain limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium based on a percentage of the Daily Value for these nutrients. Around 5% of all packaged foods in the current marketplace are labeled as 'healthy.' Foods that could previously carry the healthy label, such as white bread and heavily sweetened cereal and yogurt, will reportedly no longer qualify as such. However, some nuts, seeds, salmon, olive oil, peanut butter, and canned fruits and vegetables may qualify. The FDA is also working on a symbol that can be put on packages to help consumers more easily identify foods that are considered healthy, and it's developing a plan for nutrition labeling that would go on the front of food packaging to complement the more in-depth labels on the back. As FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert M. Califf, said, 'The FDA is committed to providing consumers with accurate and helpful information about the foods they eat.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:44 PM\nSource:[RetailWire](https://retailwire.com/fda-delays-labeling-healthy-foods/)\n\n**New SEP Regulation: List of Foods No Longer Allowed in Schools**\nAs of March 29, all schools in Mexico will be required to follow new guidelines for healthy eating established by the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) and the Ministry of Health (Ssa). According to SEP head Mario Delgado, this regulation is part of the 'New Guidelines for Healthy Living', which aims to promote healthy eating habits among students. The new guidelines prohibit the sale of any food or drink with warning labels on their packaging, including individual products or multi-packaged items. Some of the foods that will no longer be allowed to be sold in school cooperatives include: '...'. Schools that fail to comply with these regulations may face economic penalties, as outlined in the General Education Law. The measure is supported by Article 301 of the General Health Law, which prohibits the distribution of high-energy, low-nutritional foods in school environments. As an alternative to prohibited products, UNICEF proposes healthy snacks for students, including recipes such as lentil salad and whole grain porridge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:37 PM\nSource:[Revista Proceso](https://www.proceso.com.mx/ciencia-tecnologia/salud/2025/3/4/nueva-norma-de-la-sep-que-alimentos-ya-no-se-venderan-en-las-escuelas-346715.html)\n\n**2024 State of the Industry: Better bites**\nThe state of the industry in 2024 reveals that consumers continue to snack, but their preferences are constantly changing.

Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy highlighted that 10% of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) budget is spent on sugary drinks, such as soda. The Healthy SNAP Act, introduced by Kennedy and Senator Marco Rubio, would prohibit the purchase of junk food and sugary drinks with SNAP benefits. The bill aims to cut wasteful government spending and prioritize the health and well-being of Americans. According to the USDA, taxpayers will spend over $240 billion on junk food through SNAP over the next decade, including over $60 billion on soda. This is unsustainable and contributes to America's skyrocketing healthcare crisis. Kennedy said, 'No one is saying that Americans can\u2019t buy these products\u2014but they should do so with their own money, not taxpayer funds.' The Healthy SNAP Act would encourage Americans to lead long, healthy, and fulfilling lives, and is a crucial step in Making America Healthy Again.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 05:38 AM\nSource:[conservativeangle.com](https://conservativeangle.com/to-make-america-healthy-again-make-snap-healthy/)\n\n**USDA Issues 326-Page List of Contaminated Chicken Products**\nThe US Department of Agriculture has issued a 326-page list of products contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, including ready-to-eat chicken products sold at Walmart, Aldi, and other stores. The contamination was discovered after routine inspections by the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The affected products were produced between June 19, 2024, and October 8, 2024, and were shipped to stores and distributors across the country. The list includes products from various brands, such as 7-Eleven, Amazon Kitchen, H-E-B, Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Walmart. Consumers are advised to check their products for the establishment number '51205 or P-51205' on the USDA inspection mark. Some of the affected products include: 7-Eleven's Caesar Salad with Chicken, Amazon Kitchen's Grilled Chicken Wrap, H-E-B's Southwestern Style Chicken Salad, Kroger's Southwest Chicken Salad, and Trader Joe's Chicken Caesar Salad. The US Department of Agriculture is conducting an internal investigation into the matter. 'Consuming contaminated food with listeria can cause listeriosis, a severe infection that can lead to fever, muscle aches, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms,' said the USDA. 'It is essential to check the products for the establishment number and discard them if they are contaminated.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 03:06 PM\nSource:[telemundodenver.com](https://www.telemundodenver.com/responde/retiro-de-productos/brucepac-retiran-comidas-pollo-walmart-aldi-listeria-mira-lista/2369624/)\n\n**Iowa House bill seeks to limit SNAP purchases, faces backlash over narrow food options**\nIowa House Republicans have advanced a bill that would limit SNAP purchases to items like fresh meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, rice, pasta, and bread. Opponents argue this would effectively ban 2/3 of the grocery store, leaving little room for religious or medical dietary requirements, food allergies, and cultural preferences. The bill also includes $1 million for the Double Up Food Bucks program, but this funding is contingent on the USDA approving Iowa's food restrictions. Rep. Shannon Lundgren said, 'I obviously do believe that food insecurity is a real epidemic in our country. I think we need to have everything on the table we need to discuss every single option.' Luke Elzinga, policy and advocacy manager for the Des Moines Area Religious Council, said, 'I don\u2019t have time to list all the foods this bill would ban, but it\u2019s effectively 2/3 of the grocery store.'

The proposed changes include banning sugary drinks, highly processed foods, and certain unhealthy foods, according to the Associated Press. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, have expressed their support for the elimination of these items from the program. Kennedy stated, 'The federal government is paying for these products in many cases, and we shouldn't be subsidizing people to consume poison.' Rollins emphasized the importance of ensuring that public funds are used for healthy foods for children and vulnerable adults. However, implementing restrictions on SNAP is a complex process, requiring Congressional approval or state exemptions. Some states have previously attempted to exclude certain products from the SNAP list, but none of these proposals have been approved. The USDA has argued that there are no clear standards for categorizing foods as 'healthy' or 'unhealthy,' and that applying restrictions would be costly and complicated. SNAP affects over 42 million Americans who rely on the program for essential food assistance, with each beneficiary receiving around $187 per month. Experts and organizations have expressed concern about the impact of these restrictions on low-income communities, with some arguing that it is another way to reduce benefits and stigmatize those in need.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/estos-son-los-alimentos-que-donald-trump-quiere-quitar-del-programa-snap-nid21022025/)\n\n**Millions of shoppers face purchase bans on junk food under new USDA chief**\nNewly-appointed agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins plans to restrict the purchase of junk food using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.

This federal benefit has helped millions of Americans access healthy food. With the pandemic, the need to adapt to new technologies led to the program allowing online purchases. Since then, more states and retailers have joined this option, providing beneficiaries with greater flexibility and accessibility. In 2025, the possibility of buying food with SNAP online continues to expand. Beneficiaries have access to a variety of options to acquire products in online supermarkets, improving convenience and reducing the need to travel to physical stores. However, for this system to work, states and retailers must comply with certain requirements established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). This article addresses how to use SNAP benefits for online purchases, which states have implemented this option, and which retailers accept the benefit. Each state sets its own rules for using SNAP online, and some require beneficiaries to register in advance on a specific platform, while others allow direct purchases from retailer websites. Eligible products can vary by state, but generally include unprocessed or prepared foods, such as fresh produce, meat, and canned goods. The service of online purchases with SNAP began as a limited option, but is now available in most US states. The US Department of Agriculture has worked to expand the program's coverage, allowing beneficiaries from all states to access this option. However, there are some exceptions, as some territories have not yet implemented the option of digital purchases with SNAP. In 2025, the program is available in all states, although with certain particularities. For example, in states like California, New York, and Texas, beneficiaries can use their benefits on various e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Walmart. In other states, such as Florida or Illinois, it is also possible to make online purchases, although the options of retailers may be more limited. The expansion of this modality has facilitated beneficiaries the option of not having to travel, which has been an advantage, especially for those with mobility difficulties. As the acceptance of SNAP online has expanded, several major retailers have begun to accept this benefit as a form of payment for their products. Main chains of supermarkets such as Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are some of the most notable in accepting payments through SNAP on their digital platforms. Additionally, many local retailers in specific states have also joined the initiative so that beneficiaries can take advantage of their benefits. It is essential to note that only eligible foods for SNAP can be acquired with this benefit. Products such as alcoholic beverages, dietary supplements, and personal hygiene items are excluded. Therefore, it is essential that beneficiaries review well the policies of retailers to ensure that they are buying products that comply with the program's regulations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2025/02/18/snap-conoce-como-y-los-estados-de-estados-unidos-donde-puedes-realizar-tus-compras-en-linea-este-2025-lrtmusv-421956)\n\n**Trump's USDA might not let people use food stamps to buy junk food and soda**\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the Trump administration may ban the use of food stamps to buy 'sugary drinks' and junk food.

However, there are restrictions on the products that can be purchased with SNAP, excluding tobacco, alcohol, hot meals, and non-food items. To qualify for the program, beneficiaries must meet certain requirements, including government-established labor standards.

In February 2025, the program, managed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), will provide financial assistance to approximately 42 million people, ensuring access to basic food items. SNAP benefits are deposited onto Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards, which allow users to purchase essential food items, such as bread, meat, fruits, and vegetables. However, there are restrictions on their use, including the prohibition on buying supplements, pet food, alcohol, cigarettes, and non-food items. The SNAP payment schedule varies by state, with different dates for each state. According to the USDA, the program has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for beneficiaries and contributing to the local economy by supporting small and large food businesses. It is essential for beneficiaries to check their specific payment dates and verify their EBT card balance. Unused funds remain available until they are spent, but they are not accumulative indefinitely. In February 2025, SNAP reaffirms its role as a lifeline for millions of families, promoting well-being and food security across the country.

But what we\u2019re saying is, don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.' The bill would require SNAP-eligible foods to 'promote the health of SNAP recipients and reflect nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns.' Currently, SNAP benefits can be used to purchase fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy, bread, cereal, and snack foods, but not junk food or sugary drinks. The proposed bill would exclude soft drinks, ice cream, prepared desserts, and other similar products. With over 42 million Americans receiving SNAP benefits, the bill aims to reduce the 20% of federal SNAP spending that goes towards junk foods and sugary drinks, which contribute to the high rates of obesity in the US, with 75% of adults and 33% of American children being overweight or obese.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[al.com](https://www.al.com/news/2025/01/snap-recipients-may-be-barred-from-buying-junk-food-under-new-gop-bill.html)\n\n",
