With the win, the Thunder improved to 54-12, securing an 81.8% win rate and mathematically clinching a playoff spot. The Celtics, who attempted a franchise-record 63 three-pointers, were held to just 20 made shots from beyond the arc by the Thunder's defense. The game was a closely contested affair, with the lead changing hands several times, but the Thunder ultimately emerged victorious thanks to a clutch three-pointer from Kenrich Williams and free throws from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[uol.com.br](https://www.uol.com.br/esporte/basquete/2025/03/13/oklahoma-city-thunder-derrota-celtics-e-se-garante-nos-playoffs.htm)\n\n**Thunder Defeats Celtics, Secures Playoff Spot**\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Boston Celtics 118-112 in the 2024-2025 NBA regular season game, securing their playoff spot.
