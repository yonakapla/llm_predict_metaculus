SoftBank's planned $40 billion investment in OpenAI would value the company at nearly $300 billion, almost double its valuation from October. Anthropic's new valuation will be more than triple its previous valuation, while Together AI raised $305 million at a $3.3 billion valuation, a 160% jump from its previous valuation. Harvey, an AI legal tech startup, raised $300 million at a $3 billion valuation, doubling its valuation in just 200 days. Safe Superintelligence, an AI research lab, is in talks to raise another $1 billion at a $30 billion valuation, a sixfold increase from its previous valuation. The trend of AI startups with sky-high valuations and little to no revenue must eventually come to an end, as VCs face a slow IPO and M&A market, investing in companies that could take more than a decade to produce a return.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/valuation-escalation-february-2025-openai-anthropic/)\n\n**Anthropic Reaches $61.5 Billion Valuation After Record-Breaking Funding Round**\nAnthropic, a leading AI startup, has reached a valuation of $61.5 billion after a recent funding round. This is a significant increase from its valuation of $16 billion just over a year ago. The company's success is attributed to its advanced chatbot AI, Claude, which has recently received an update with the Sonnet 3.7 version. The new version introduces hybrid reasoning, which improves the model's ability to understand and respond more accurately and articulately. This technological advancement has attracted new investments and strengthened Anthropic's position in the market, putting it in direct competition with giants like OpenAI. The latest funding round has brought in $3.5 billion for Anthropic, with the support of venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners. Since its founding in 2021, the company has raised over $14.8 billion from investors such as Amazon, Google, and Salesforce. Amazon has already invested $8 billion and is working closely with Anthropic, with the new Alexa Plus assistant being developed using the startup's technology. The AI market is experiencing a new wave of investments, with OpenAI nearing a $40 billion funding round that would value the company at $300 billion, and xAI, Elon Musk's company, negotiating a financing deal that could take it above $75 billion.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 09:57 AM\nSource:[Tecnoandroid](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2025/03/06/anthropic-cresce-a-ritmi-record-valutazione-schizzata-a-615-miliardi-1532593/)\n\n**SoundHound AI, Inc.

According to Anthropic, the latest investment 'fuels our development of more intelligent and capable AI systems that expand what humans can achieve' and that 'continued advances in scaling across all aspects of model training are powering breakthroughs in intelligence and expertise.' Krishna Rao, Anthropic's CFO, said in a release. Meanwhile, SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) has been reaffirmed as a 'Buy' stock by H.C. Wainwright analyst Scott Buck, who is optimistic about the company's fourth-quarter performance and its upward revision in 2025 revenue guidance.

This funding round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, demonstrates the growing interest in AI and the impact that companies like Anthropic are having on the sector. The company plans to use these funds to develop next-generation AI systems, expand its computing capacity, and deepen its research on interpretability and alignment of models. Anthropic aims to create AI systems that can act as true collaborators, helping businesses and organizations solve complex problems and optimize processes. The company has recently launched its new flagship model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which introduces improvements in 'hybrid reasoning'. This model seeks to simplify the user experience, avoiding the need to manually select different versions of AI, as is the case with other platforms. The business of Anthropic is booming, with an annual revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2024, and a 30% increase in the first half of 2025. However, the expansion also comes with a high cost, with the company estimated to burn $3 billion this year on the development of its AI systems. To address these challenges, Anthropic has diversified its offerings, launching new tools and subscriptions, including computational agents, a desktop version, and mobile applications. The company has also strengthened its collaboration with Amazon, which has invested $4 billion in Anthropic and works with it to optimize its AI training chips, Trainium. Additionally, Anthropic has reinforced its team with high-level hires, including Mike Krieger (co-founder of Instagram), Durk Kingma (co-founder of OpenAI), and Jan Leike (former security researcher at OpenAI).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 01:01 PM\nSource:[WWWhat's new](https://wwwhatsnew.com/2025/03/05/anthropic-recibe-una-inversion-de-3-5-mil-millones-de-dolares-para-potenciar-su-ia/)\n\n**Anthropic Receives $3.5 Billion Investment, Valuing Company at $61.5 Billion**\nAnthropic, a startup of artificial intelligence (AI) that rivals OpenAI, announced on Monday, 3, that it closed a new round of investments, valuing the company at $61.5 billion - more than a year ago, it was worth over $16 billion.

Since its founding in 2021, Anthropic has raised over $14.8 billion from investment firms such as Menlo Ventures and tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Salesforce. The deal comes amid an increase in investments in well-known AI startups. OpenAI, for example, is set to conclude a funding agreement worth $40 billion, valuing the company at $300 billion, nearly double its valuation just five months ago. xAI, led by Elon Musk, is in negotiations for a new funding round that could value it at up to $75 billion, up from $40 billion just two months ago. Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, said in a 2023 podcast interview that there was a 10-25% chance that AI technology could destroy humanity. However, in October, he adopted a more optimistic tone, publishing a 14,000-word essay on the potential benefits of AI. 'I think most people are underestimating how radical the positive side of AI can be, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks can be,' he wrote.

The funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with investors including Salesforce Ventures, Cisco Investments, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, has already received $8 billion from Amazon and $2 billion from Alphabet (Google) in 2024. The startup, based in San Francisco, is differentiating itself in the increasingly sophisticated AI race by focusing on the dangers associated with this technology. The funds will be used to develop new, more advanced versions of its model, Claude, as well as to increase its computing capacity, deepen its research on AI and its 'alignment' with human values, and accelerate its international expansion. According to Jared Kaplan, co-founder of Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a 'hybrid' model that can provide immediate answers to any question, but also reason and respond to more complex topics. The year 2023 was marked by the competition between ChatGPT interfaces, which have since acquired the ability to understand and produce images and sounds (multimodality), and are now gaining in 'reason' and autonomy. OpenAI has again taken the lead with the release of o1 in September, the first model to 'reason', but Anthropic has outdone it with the release of 'Computer Use' in October, a feature that allows Claude to use computers like a human.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 11:29 PM\nSource:[NotreTemps.com](https://www.notretemps.com/depeches/ia-anthropic-valorisee-a-615-milliards-de-dollars-apres-une-levee-de-fonds-109711)\n\n**10 AI Startups Set to Explode in 2025: An Early Investment Guide**\nTen AI startups are poised for explosive growth in 2025, making them prime candidates for early investment.

This is a significant increase from its previous valuation of $18 billion. Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January that he believes AI will surpass human intelligence in the next 2-3 years.

However, the pricing of the new model remains uncertain, and some experts question whether Anthropic's strategy of offering a 'sliding scale' of computational resources will be enough to compete with OpenAI's low-cost models. Anthropic's CEO has stated that the company aims to reach $345 billion in revenue by 2027, with a significant portion coming from its API business. The company has also announced plans to reduce its cash burn to $3 billion in 2025, from $5.6 billion in 2023.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 03:33 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/csj/2025-02-14/doc-inekmitk7538892.shtml)\n\n**Anthropic sees revenue potentially soaring to $34.5 billion in...**\nAnthropic, an AI startup, projects its revenue to reach $34.5 billion in 2027, according to a report by The Information. In a base case scenario, the company expects revenue to reach $12 billion in 2027, up from $2.2 billion in 2025. Anthropic's management expects the company to stop burning cash in 2027, after burning $5.6 billion last year. The company sells access to its models directly and through third-party cloud services, including Amazon Web Services. Anthropic is nearing a deal to raise $2 billion at a price that values the company at $60 billion, according to Reuters. This comes after OpenAI triggered an AI arms race with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, leading to outsized funding rounds for companies like Anthropic and xAI. 'We expect to stop burning cash in 2027,' said Anthropic's management, as reported by The Information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 02:40 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-14391855/Anthropic-sees-revenue-potentially-soaring-34-5-billion-2027-The-Information-reports.html)\n\n**Anthropic Plans to Enhance Claude with Two-Way Voice Mode and Personalization**\nAnthropic, a leading AI startup, is continually enhancing its AI chatbot Claude. According to Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, Claude has received a warm market response in the past few months. In the coming months, the company plans to release a more intelligent AI model, which will include a two-way voice mode, allowing users to speak to Claude and receive responses. This two-way voice model aims to provide a seamless interaction experience, similar to ChatGPT's advanced voice mode. Additionally, Anthropic plans to strengthen Claude's memory function, enabling it to provide personalized experiences. With improved memory, Claude can remember user interactions, such as their interests in sports or knitting, and use this information in future conversations. This will allow Claude to generate personalized interactions over time. Anthropic has gained significant attention as a rival to OpenAI, with its large language model Claude. In 2024, Anthropic released a feature to develop automated agents for enterprise processes, ahead of OpenAI. Claude has received investments from Amazon and Google, totaling $137 billion. Google has agreed to invest an additional $1 billion in Anthropic, on top of its existing 10% stake.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[iThome Online](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/167164)\n\n**Anthropic Snags Another $1B From Amazon; OpenAI Joins Data Center Push**\nAnthropic, a ChatGPT rival, has secured a $1 billion investment from Google, its previous investor.

The funding round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei, a former OpenAI research vice president, and his sister Daniela Amodei, Anthropic aims to create a reliable, explainable, and controllable AI system. As of now, Anthropic has raised $13.7 billion in funding, exceeding OpenAI's total investment of $21.9 billion by 60%. The company has expanded its team from 240 people in 2023 to 1,035 people in September 2024, with many Chinese talent joining the team. One of the new hires is Yao Shunyu, a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, who joined Anthropic's Claude team in October 2024 to work on large model research. Anthropic's organizational structure has three research teams: interpretability, alignment, and social impact. The company's website features a list of important papers, including some authors with Chinese names, such as Jesse Mu and Yuntao Bai. According to AMiner's report, Chinese talent accounts for 18.7% of the core members of global large model teams. OpenAI's GPT-4 development team has 32 Asian members, with 9 of them graduating from top Chinese universities. Anthropic's rapid growth and team expansion are driven by global AI talent exchange and cooperation. As more Chinese AI experts choose to work or study in the US, a pattern of 'Chinese talent + American education' is emerging. In the future, it is possible that Chinese-led AI companies will emerge, such as DeepSeek-V3, which was released in 2024.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 02:28 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1704103183_65928d0f020069zca.html?from=finance)\n\n**Anthropic Seeks $60 Billion Valuation in Latest Funding Round**\nAnthropic, a startup company, is reportedly seeking to raise funds at a valuation of $60 billion, according to CB Insights. This would make it the fifth most valuable startup in the US, behind SpaceX, OpenAI, Stripe, and Databricks. The company has received most of its funding from its close partner Amazon. Anthropic's annual revenue has recently increased to $875 million, mostly from corporate sales. The company's CEO, Dario Amodei, has stated that powerful AI could be developed by 2026, which would be able to control any software or hardware and perform most human tasks better. Amodei has also written that the 21st century could see a doubling of human lifespan, from 75 to 150 years. Anthropic has also announced a new feature called 'computer use' that allows AI to perform complex tasks like humans, such as booking flights, filling out forms, and conducting online research. According to PitchBook, AI startups in the US raised a record $97 billion in 2024, accounting for 46.4% of total startup funding. Sequoia Capital's David Cahn has written that 2024 is the 'planting' year for AI, and 2025 will be the 'rooting' year. Databricks, a data and AI startup, has raised $100 billion in its largest funding round to date, valuing the company at $62 billion. Databricks' AI product VP, Naveen Rao, has stated that there are fewer than 1,000 researchers who can create new AI models, making them as rare as LeBron James.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 02:22 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=5af38345-72bc-45d4-90fc-598e28c46a95)\n\n**Anthropic reportedly in talks to raise $2B at $60B valuation, led by Lightspeed | TechCrunch**\nAnthropic, an OpenAI rival, is reportedly in talks to raise $2 billion in a new funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the company at $60 billion.
