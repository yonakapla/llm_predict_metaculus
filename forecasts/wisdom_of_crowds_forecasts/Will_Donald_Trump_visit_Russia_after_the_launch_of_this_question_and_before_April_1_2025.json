South Africa has maintained good relations with Russia, despite not condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. According to spokesman Vincent Magwenya, the visit is part of ongoing efforts to find a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine. Zelenskiy's visit comes at a pivotal moment in the war, following his public feud with Donald Trump and the U.S. decision to halt military aid to Kyiv.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 10:20 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraines-zelenskiy-visit-south-africa-101438244.html)\n\n**Zelensky to Visit South Africa Next Month to Discuss Ukraine-Russia Peace**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to visit South Africa next month, according to Bloomberg.

Trump added that the Saudi investments will be for 'buying military equipment and other things.' He described his relationship with the Saudis as 'great.' Trump mentioned that his visit to Saudi Arabia will be one of his first foreign trips since taking office in January 2024. He also stated that he will visit the kingdom before the UK, which is his usual first destination. In 2017, Trump visited Saudi Arabia in his first foreign trip as president, where he received a grand welcome and secured deals and investments worth over $380 billion in various fields, which was a 10-year investment. Regarding the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump stated that Ukraine 'wants to reach an agreement.' He considered that Kiev 'has no other option' but to end the war, and that Russia also 'wants to reach an agreement.' Trump added that Russia 'has a different way that no one knows except me and myself,' and that it also 'has no other option.' When asked about the possibility of revoking the temporary legal status of over 200,000 Ukrainians in the US who fled the war, Trump said that he will make a decision 'very soon.' He added that 'we do not want to harm anyone, and we will look into this matter.' Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, announced that Saudi Arabia will host a meeting between American and Ukrainian officials next week to discuss the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1/3502594)\n\n**Trump to Visit Saudi Arabia in April, Breaking Tradition**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that he will visit Saudi Arabia in April, his first overseas trip.

Not so much the allies of 1945, but their joint agreement on Ukraine peace talks, which, according to the Kellogg Plan, will end... on May 9,' the article states. This is not Trump's first visit to Moscow for this occasion, but in a different context. In 1995, Bill Clinton visited Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on May 9, despite disagreements on Bosnia, Iran, and NATO expansion. 'If a new agreement between the US and Russia is signed and Trump's invitation is accepted, Europeans will symbolically drain their glasses on May 9, 2025, watching on their screens as Russian troops welcome the American president,' the author concludes.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly hoping to meet with Trump before Putin, potentially beating his Russian counterpart to the meeting.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 06:46 PM\nSource:[news.ru](https://news.ru/europe/vo-francii-nazvali-neozhidannogo-gostya-na-prazdnovanii-dnya-pobedy-v-moskve/)\n\n**Donald Trump to Visit Russia on Victory Day, Symbolizing Defeat for Europe**\nAccording to a recent article, Donald Trump is planning to visit Russia on Victory Day (May 9th) in 2025. The article suggests that this would be a victory for Vladimir Putin, who has compared Ukrainians to Nazis to justify his invasion of Ukraine. If a new US-Russia deal is reached, it would be a symbolic defeat for Europeans, who would be forced to watch Russian soldiers on TV, including those on Red Square in Moscow, as Trump praises them. As the article notes, 'What victory will Putin and Donald Trump be celebrating on May 9, 2025? Not the one achieved by the Allies in 1945, but their own, joint victory, in the negotiations on Ukraine, which, according to the plan (special envoy of US President Donald Trump, Keith Kellogg) would be finalized... on May 9.'\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/wiadomosci/donald-trump-przyjedzie-do-rosji-na-obchody-dnia-zwyciestwa/yybyb3l)\n\n**Russian and US Officials to Meet in Riyadh to Discuss Relations and Ukraine**\nHigh-level Russian and US officials will meet in Riyadh on Tuesday to discuss improving relations, a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, and a summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitri Peskov announced that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's deputy Yuri Ushakov will travel to Riyadh on Monday. Peskov stated that the meetings will 'primarily focus on restoring the overall complex of Russian-American relations.' He also mentioned that they will discuss several security issues and 'separate discussions on possible negotiations for a solution in Ukraine and organizing a meeting between the two heads of state.' Peskov also announced that an American citizen who was detained at Moscow Airport on Friday on suspicion of bringing contraband has been released. Peskov said, 'Given that the relations will be re-established on Tuesday, these events can be evaluated in this context.' Russia had previously requested that NATO withdraw its troops from some Eastern European countries before launching a large-scale military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also traveling to Riyadh to attend the meetings, which will be accompanied by Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and the White House's Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after the meeting between Russian and US officials. Zelensky's spokesperson Sergiy Nikiforov stated that Zelensky will visit Saudi Arabia as part of a 'long-planned' official visit with his wife. US President Trump had announced last week that he and Putin had agreed to start negotiations on ending the Ukraine war during a phone call.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/tr/rus-ve-abdli-yetkililer-riyadda-bulu%C5%9Facak/a-71638546)\n\n**Stepashin Predicts Trump's Visit to Russia Will Be a Sensation**\nFormer Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov expressed confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump will meet before May 9th this year. Stepanov believes that their meeting will be a significant event, saying, 'If Trump comes to Russia on Victory Day, that will be a sensation.' Stepanov noted that both leaders prioritize their countries and have found common ground due to their shared approach to decision-making, which he described as, 'A person says - a person does.' The two leaders discussed Ukraine, agreeing on the need for peaceful negotiations to resolve the conflict. Trump invited Putin to visit the US, and Putin extended an invitation to Trump to visit Moscow during their phone call on February 12th.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 10:23 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/02/16/stepashin-zaiavil-chto-priezd-trampa-v-rossiiu-na-den-pobedy-proizvedet-furor.html)\n\n**Russia Anticipates a 'Furore' if Trump Visits on Victory Day**\nFormer Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov announced a 'furore' if US President Donald Trump were to visit Russia on Victory Day, May 9, 2025. Stepanov expects a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump to take place before May 9, similar to last year. 'If Trump were to come to Victory Day, that would be a furore,' he said. Stepanov believes that the two presidents have similar priorities, with a focus on their respective countries, and that they understand each other and take their statements seriously. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously stated that Putin is willing to welcome Trump at the Victory Day parade on May 9.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/02/16/v-rossii-anonsirovali-furor-v-sluchae-priezda-trampa-na-den-pobedy/)\n\n**US Special Envoy to Ukraine May Visit Russia Before Putin-Trump Meeting**\nUS special envoy to Ukraine, Kit Kellog, may visit Russia before the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President-elect Donald Trump, according to Americanist and political scientist Malak Dudakov. Dudakov stated that all diplomatic activity will begin after Trump's inauguration on January 20. 'It's too early to judge and speculate, we will first see the activity of diplomats', Dudakov said. He did not rule out the possibility that Moscow and Washington could find common ground on issues related to the Ukrainian conflict, but also noted that the complex situation in Russia-West relations will likely persist. Trump previously stated that the conflict on Ukraine was sparked by the administration of US President Joe Biden, and emphasized that Russia launched the Special Military Operation because his predecessor and his allies were incompetent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 02:54 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/politics/politolog-dudakov-kellog-mozhet-priehat-v-rf-do-vstrechi-putina-i-trampa)\n\n**Putin to Discuss New National Projects on January 9**\nRussian President Putin will discuss the launch of new national projects on January 9. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak will present a report on the topic. According to the Kremlin, 'a number of current issues will also be considered.' Previously, Putin spoke with 9th-grader Arina Porhal from Gorlovka via phone, fulfilling her wish to visit St. Petersburg as part of the 'Christmas Tree of Wishes' charity event. US President-elect Donald Trump stated that he is aware of Putin's willingness to engage in dialogue, but believes that negotiations can only take place after his inauguration. Trump noted that he cannot yet specify the exact date for the proposed dialogue with Putin.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[360.ru](https://360.ru/news/vlast/putin-9-janvarja-obsudit-zapusk-novyh-natsproektov/)\n\n**Trump Aims to Negotiate Peace Agreement between Ukraine and Russia before Easter**\nFormer US President Donald Trump plans to negotiate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia before Easter, according to Robert Clark, a scientific associate at the Yorktown Institute. Clark stated, 'It will be incredibly difficult for Ukraine. I think the American side will certainly aim to conclude any agreement by Easter. It all depends on how willing Vladimir Putin is to make concessions, especially in areas like Kursk, and how willing President Volodymyr Zelensky is to make concessions.' The agreement may be signed by April 20, 2025. Trump has appointed General Keith Kellogg as a special representative to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine after Trump takes office. According to Kellogg's plan, the front line will be frozen by stopping fire and introducing a demilitarized zone. Russia will receive limited sanctions relief in exchange for its agreement, and full relief will only be granted after the signing of a peace agreement acceptable to Ukraine. Ukraine was not asked to give up its claim to occupied territories, but it must achieve this through diplomatic means. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that before any possible negotiations with Russia, he plans to discuss with President Trump how to jointly stop Putin. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine's position will be crucial for European partners, as the war is taking place on Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine has the right to the loudest voice in these negotiations. 'We will agree with Trump, and after that, there can be a conversation with the Russians,' Zelensky said.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[delo.ua](https://delo.ua/news/tramp-bude-namagatis-uklasti-mirnu-ugodu-miz-ukrayinoyu-ta-rf-do-velikodnya-440157/)\n\n",

The initial probabilities set by most experts were low, ranging from 5% to 10%, taking into account geopolitical tensions, logistical challenges, and current personal and legal circumstances surrounding Trump. These probabilities were uniformly adjusted down to 0% following phase 2, where additional news articles reinforced the analysis that Trump had no plans or announced visits to Russia within the specified timeframe. Instead, Trump's focus appears directed towards Saudi Arabia, with explicit statements ruling out a visit to Russia by the deadline.",
