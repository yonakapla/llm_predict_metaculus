He criticized the ufology media environment, calling it a 'snake pit', and warned against spreading unverified stories. Dr. Greer, a seasoned scientist, has consistently called out disinformation attempts, aiming to prevent a mix of truth and falsehoods from misleading the public and influencing government proceedings.

The total lunar eclipse will occur on March 13th and will be visible in most of the Western Hemisphere. It will start at 21:57 hours (Central Mexican Time) and will be visible as a 'blood moon' in many parts of the world, including Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, South America, and the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic, and Antarctic Oceans. The eclipse will end at 4:00 hours on March 14th. A partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29th, but will only be visible in a few regions of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Europe, Northern Asia, North and West Africa, and Northwest Canada. According to experts, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow, which can shorten or block some of the sunlight reflected by the Moon. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon blocks the sunlight from reaching the Earth, while a partial solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly aligned, causing a small part of the Sun's surface to appear dark. These events are relatively rare and can be observed from the night side of the Earth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https://www.viveusa.mx/destinos/estos-son-los-eclipses-que-habra-en-marzo-de-2025-cuando-donde-y-como-verlos/)\n\n**Two Astronomical Events in March 2025: A Total Lunar Eclipse and a Partial Solar Eclipse**\nIn March 2025, there will be two astronomical events: a total lunar eclipse on March 21 and a partial solar eclipse on March 29. The partial solar eclipse will be visible in areas such as Europe, North Africa, and North Russia, but not in Argentina. According to astronomer, 'the eclipse will start at 8:50 local time and reach its maximum at 10:47, ending at 12:43.' It is essential to take precautions when observing the solar eclipse, as looking directly at the Sun can cause permanent eye damage. 'Los eclipses are unique opportunities to observe natural phenomena that do not occur frequently,' and they provide a chance for people worldwide to connect with the universe and science. With proper precautions, both events can be enjoyed safely.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/informacion-general/marzo-traera-dos-eclipses-uno-visible-la-argentina-n6120106)\n\n**Asean News Headlines at 10pm on Wednesday (March 5, 2025)**\nThe Asean region saw a variety of news headlines on March 5, 2025.

He described flying 150 feet above an 'egg-shaped' object devoid of any engine or thermal signatures, saying, 'I saw an egg, a white egg.'

This incident is one of several recent UFO sightings, including a temporary suspension of operations at the Gaziantep Airport in Turkey due to a reported UFO sighting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/shows/story/the-buzz-leaked-recording-us-air-force-pilot-reports-ufo-over-california-in-2024-glbs-2683725-2025-02-23)\n\n**Augustin Senghor Officially Announces Candidacy for FIFA Council Seat**\nAugustin Senghor, the president of the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF), has officially announced his candidacy for a seat on the FIFA Council. At 59 years old, Senghor aims to take on a new challenge in his career as a football administrator, contributing to the major decisions of world football. According to Senghor, 'I thought the time had come to offer my services, my skills, and my experience to the realization of the convergent vision of our two Leaders, Gianni Infantino, President of FIFA, and Dr. Patrice Motsepe, President of CAF, for a strong and future-oriented African football.' Senghor has over 15 years of experience leading Senegalese football, and has held influential positions within CAF and FIFA, including member of the CAF Executive Committee, president of the UFOA A zone, and first vice-president of CAF. He emphasizes his commitment and passion for developing African football in his letter to African federations, stating, 'I am therefore pleased to come explicitly and with humility to solicit the vote of your Federation and your support for my candidacy, convinced that I can bring a plus to our continent and its football in the FIFA Council, where the most important decisions for world football and, by ricochet, for African football are made.' Senghor will face his peers at the CAF Congress on March 12, 2025, to secure one of the African representative seats on the FIFA Council.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 04:36 PM\nSource:[africafootunited.com](https://africafootunited.com/fifa-augustin-senghor-officiellement-candidat-au-poste-de-conseiller/)\n\n**US Air Force pilot reports close encounter with \u2018football-sized\u2019 UFO in leaked audio**\nA U.S. Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' reported a close encounter with a 'football-sized,' dark gray, cylindrical object while flying a Beechcraft 350 C over California on September 17, 2024. The object passed just 10 feet beneath his aircraft's wing at 20,000 feet in controlled airspace near Los Angeles. According to the leaked audio, Troy 21 radioed air traffic control, saying, 'This is going to sound weird, but I just had something pass underneath my wing. Maybe a football-sized object right under my wing.' The object was detected on the jet's air-to-air system and radar approximately 60 miles away, leading experts to question whether it was a conventional drone or aircraft. Ben Hansen, a former FBI agent, noted that the speed and altitude made a drone explanation unlikely, saying, 'It would have exceeded Mach 2 in two minutes.' The incident has sparked intrigue and speculation about unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP), with some drawing parallels to other reported UAP encounters by military personnel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[endtimeheadlines.org](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2025/02/us-air-force-pilot-reports-close-encounter-with-football-sized-ufo-in-leaked-audio/)\n\n**Don\u2019t Miss These Astrophotography Opportunities in March 2025**\nMarch 2025 brings several astrophotography opportunities, including Mercury at its greatest eastern elongation on March 8, a full worm moon and total lunar eclipse on March 14, and a partial solar eclipse on March 29.

Barber alleges that he was involved in the evacuation of a crashed UFO to a secret base in Nevada, and that he has experienced strange symptoms, including hair loss and severe burns, which he believes are related to his exposure to the UFO. The US government has acknowledged the existence of a secret program to study UFOs, and a former CIA agent has confirmed that the program is still active. The FBI has also confirmed that it has a special unit dedicated to investigating UFO sightings. Barber's claims have been corroborated by other witnesses, including a former Navy pilot who claims to have seen a UFO while on a mission. The US government has been criticized for its handling of UFO sightings, with some accusing it of covering up the truth. A former NASA employee has come forward with claims that the agency has been aware of UFOs for decades, but has been silenced by the government. The issue of UFOs has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that it is a national security issue, while others believe that it is a matter of public interest. The Russian Academy of Sciences has also been involved in the search for extraterrestrial life, with a giant radio telescope in Karachay-Cherkessia capable of detecting signals from millions of light-years away. Scientists are searching for exoplanets similar to Earth, and have discovered 18 potential candidates. The search for extraterrestrial life is an ongoing effort, with scientists using a variety of methods to search for signs of life, including the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets. While there is currently no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists remain hopeful that one day they will find evidence of life beyond Earth. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 03:54 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru // \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd](https://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2877807/)\n\n**CAF Announces New Format for CAN U17 2025, Tunisia and Algeria Reprieved**\nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced a new format for the 2025 U17 African Cup of Nations (CAN U17 2025) to be held in Morocco from March 30 to April 19.

Burchett, who has previously claimed that the US government is hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life, said that the information came from an admiral, whom he did not identify. He stated that the incident was documented and reassured the American public, saying, 'I'm not worried about getting hurt.

Although the UFO topic has been ridiculed in the past, the US Congress has been increasingly taking reports of mysterious unidentified flying objects seriously. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Representative Burchett told former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who hosts a show on the right-wing media outlet One America News Network, 'They told me that there's something underwater moving at hundreds of miles per hour... it's as big as an American football field.' Burchett emphasized that this incident is documented and was told to him by a Navy Admiral, but he did not reveal the Admiral's identity. Burchett is known for claiming that the US government is hiding UFO and extraterrestrial activity, and he believes that anything is possible in the vast universe. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that intelligent life exists outside of Earth. Despite this, the US Congress is increasingly taking reports of mysterious flying objects seriously, turning the once-mocked UFO topic into a serious issue.

However, global interest in UFOs and technological advancements in Africa were seen as potential positive influences. After reviewing related news articles, experts largely maintained or slightly adjusted their probabilities, with final estimates ranging from 5% to 25%. The updates reinforced the ongoing global interest in UFO phenomena, but no direct evidence of increased pilot reports from Africa in March 2025 was found. Consequently, the probability estimates either remained unchanged or slightly increased due to global trends and increased sky observations prompted by events like the lunar eclipse.",
