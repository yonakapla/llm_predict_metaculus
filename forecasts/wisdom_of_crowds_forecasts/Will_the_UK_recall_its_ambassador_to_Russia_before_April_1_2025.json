According to Kelyin, despite numerous sanctions imposed on Russia, the country has not been isolated and continues to participate in several significant international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Kelyin emphasized the importance of these international unions and noted that several international organizations are present in London, where Russia plays a role.

We are part of a major international organization, in the UN, in OSCE, and in all others.' He added that Russia is not isolated from the world, despite numerous sanctions imposed on it. Kelin's comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin questioned why the G7 is called 'big', pointing out that the G7's GDP growth rate in 2024 was 1.9%, compared to 0.9% in the eurozone and 4.9% in BRICS. Russia's GDP growth rate has been 4.1% for two consecutive years.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0415\u041d \u0422\u0412](https://ren.tv/news/politika/1317516-kelin-zaiavil-chto-rossiia-ne-stremitsia-vnov-stat-chastiu-g8)\n\n**UK's Policy May Lead to Ukraine's Destruction, Says Russian Ambassador**\nRussian Ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, stated in an interview with Channel 4 that the UK's policy may lead to the complete destruction of Ukraine.

It is possible', Kelyin said in an interview with Channel 4. The UK has announced plans to provide Ukraine with a record \u00a34.5 billion in support in 2025.

The UK government has announced plans to allocate a record \u00a34.5 billion in 2025 for military support to Ukraine, which Russian authorities oppose, saying it hinders peaceful conflict resolution and exacerbates NATO's involvement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that any shipments of arms to Ukraine become legitimate targets for Russia, emphasizing the need for a system to protect against external interference. He also noted that US and NATO involvement in the conflict, through training Ukrainian servicemen on Western soil, including the UK, Germany, and Italy, worsens the situation. The Kremlin warns that Western military support for Ukraine undermines peace talks and may have negative consequences for international stability.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/posol-kelin-predupredil-o-riskah-britanskoj-voennoj-pomoshi-kievu-585958.html)\n\n**UK's Policy on Ukraine May Lead to Complete Destruction, Says Russian Ambassador**\nThe Russian Ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelyin, stated in an interview with Channel 4 that the UK's policy of continuing military support to Ukraine may lead to the complete destruction of Ukraine.

He mentioned that the British government is calling for continued sanctions against Russia, strengthening Ukraine to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and collapsing the Russian economy. Kelyin questioned, 'How can we perceive this?' after the UK's Ministry of Foreign Affairs revoked the accreditation of a Russian diplomat's spouse in response to Moscow's actions. The UK's actions are seen as a response to the Russian Federal Security Service's (FSB) decision to revoke the accreditation of a British diplomat's spouse in Moscow for providing false information and engaging in espionage activities.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/politika/23437977)\n\n**Russian Ambassador: US Victory of Common Sense Made Dialogue with Russia Possible**\nRussian Ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelyin, stated that the resumption of dialogue between Russia and the US is due to the victory of common sense in Washington with the arrival of President Donald Trump. Kelyin said, 'Common sense has led Americans to talk to Russia. Unfortunately, I do not see this common sense in most European leaders, except for one or two. They are not guided by common sense, instead of solving complex internal problems, they discuss international policy, play to the public, and try to impress them with their gestures.' Kelyin also suggested that in the future, Washington may relax restrictions on Moscow, which harm American companies and complicate their work in Russia. He stated, 'If the US wants to do business in Russia, they should cancel most sanctions, starting with banking restrictions.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 08:41 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/politika/23437875)\n\n**Russian ambassador to the UK on Trump Putin talks and Ukraine's future**\nDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken on the phone for over 90 minutes, leading to a 30-day energy and infrastructure ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as negotiations on a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea.

However, Kelin emphasized that Russia will only be ready for a complete end to hostilities after a comprehensive agreement is reached. Kelin noted that Russia has previously stated that a temporary ceasefire is not a viable option for resolving the situation. 'We approach this with great caution,' he said. Kelin also mentioned that a project for the Istanbul Agreements was proposed at the beginning of the full-scale war, but it was not approved. He added that Russia would have withdrawn its troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions as a gesture of goodwill before a possible ceasefire agreement, 'as a sign of good will before a possible ceasefire agreement,' according to Kelin.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 08:57 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/pripinennya-vognyu-ukrayini-posol-rosiyi-prokomentuvav-yogo_n2774501)\n\n**Russia to Consider US Proposal for Ceasefire on Ukraine, But Seeks Comprehensive Peace Agreement**\nRussia's ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelyin, stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Moscow will consider the US proposal for a ceasefire on Ukraine, but will only stop military actions when a comprehensive peace agreement is reached. According to Kelyin, Russia has repeatedly stated that a temporary ceasefire is not a viable option for resolving the situation. He also expressed skepticism about any peace negotiations, saying that a stable agreement requires time. Kelyin added that Russia approaches the US initiative 'with great caution'. The ambassador's skepticism is partly due to Russia's past experience with peace negotiations, where Ukraine and Russia developed a draft agreement in April 2022, but Ukraine later derailed the process. The US and Ukrainian delegations held talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11, 2025, which lasted almost a full day and consisted of two rounds. As a result, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, provided that Russia also agrees to it, as reported by RBC.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2025/03/13/posol-rf-v-londone-moskva-izuchit-plan-vashingtona-o-prekrashchenii-ognya-na-ukraine)\n\n**Russia to Consider US Ceasefire Proposal, But Only with Comprehensive Peace Agreement**\nRussia's ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelyin, stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Moscow will consider the US proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but will only stop military actions when a comprehensive peace agreement is reached.

The move comes in response to Russia's 'unjustified' decision to withdraw the accreditation of a British diplomat in Moscow in November. The UK Foreign Office stated that 'the UK will not accept intimidation of our staff in this way.' The UK has warned that it will consider any further actions taken by Russia as 'escalation' and will respond accordingly, based on the principle of 'reciprocity.' In November, Russia announced the expulsion of a British diplomat, accusing him of 'espionage and providing false information' upon his arrival in the country.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 03:20 PM\nSource:[kuwaitpress.net](https://ww.kuwaitpress.net/news/1880870/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7)\n\n**British Foreign Office Withdraws Diplomatic Accreditation from Russian Ambassador**\nThe British Foreign Office announced that it has recalled Russian Ambassador Andrei Kelin to inform him of the decision to withdraw diplomatic accreditation. This move comes in response to a 'unjustified and unprecedented' decision by the Russian Foreign Ministry last year to withdraw diplomatic accreditation from a British diplomat in Moscow. The British Foreign Office stated that any further actions by Russia will be considered an escalation, and will be responded to accordingly. In November 2024, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced the expulsion of the British Embassy's second secretary, Wilks Edward Brewer, after the Federal Security Service (FSB) investigation found him involved in espionage activities under the cover of his diplomatic work. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that the British Ambassador Nigel Casey was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The British Foreign Office described the allegations made by Russian authorities against the British diplomat as 'unjustified', and threatened to take retaliatory measures.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 01:42 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1644051-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A/)\n\n**UK Recalls Russian Diplomat's Accreditation in Response to Expulsion of British Diplomat**\nThe UK's Foreign Office has recalled the accreditation of a Russian diplomat in response to the expulsion of a British diplomat from Russia. According to the Foreign Office, 'We summoned the Russian ambassador for a meeting with a senior British official to recall the accreditation of the Russian diplomat.' This decision was made due to Russia's Foreign Ministry stripping the accreditation of a British diplomat in Moscow last year. The UK will consider further Russian actions as an escalation. In November 2024, the FSB reported that a British diplomat had been stripped of his accreditation in Russia for providing false information when requesting entry to the country. The diplomat, Wilks Edward Prior, replaced a spy who worked undercover at the embassy and was expelled from Moscow in August. The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador, who left the building about an hour later without commenting.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 01:40 PM\nSource:[1tv.ru](https://www.1tv.ru/news/2025-02-06/500467-mid_britanii_otozvalo_akkreditatsiyu_u_rossiyskogo_diplomata)\n\n**Russia Open to Peaceful Resolution in Ukraine, Says Ambassador Kelin**\nRussian Ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, stated that Moscow is open to a serious dialogue about a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, while remaining committed to its initial position.

He noted that Russia's military activity on the front line increases its negotiating power. Kelin highlighted that the development of events in the coming weeks and months will be crucial, and it is essential for Russia to clearly understand the topics of future negotiations. He mentioned that Moscow will rely on a peace agreement project discussed in Istanbul in the spring of 2022. A key aspect of the negotiation process will be the legitimacy of Volodymyr Zelensky, and Kelin stated that Russia will insist on holding presidential elections in Ukraine.

Kelyin believes that the UK's statements about a 'century-long partnership' and 'unbreakable bond' between the UK and Ukraine during Sunak's visit should not be taken seriously. He also noted that the UK's colonial mentality has not been eradicated and that the UK is driven by the idea of 'enslaving' Ukraine. Kelyin concluded that the UK's actions are aimed at containing Russia geopolitically and that Russia will respond to these actions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/6c34c162)\n\n",

    "summary": "The experts have revised their predictions on whether the UK will recall its ambassador to Russia before April 1, 2025, based on recent news articles indicating heightened diplomatic tensions. Initially, the probabilities ranged from 0% to 50%, with most experts estimating a low likelihood due to the rarity of such actions and the historical reluctance of the UK to recall ambassadors except in severe cases. After reviewing the new information, probabilities were generally increased, with revised probabilities ranging from 0% to 85%. The highest revised probability of 85% was given by the ImmigrationLawAsylumProcessAndLegalStandardsAgent, who noted significant diplomatic conflict and the recall of the Russian ambassador by the UK as reinforcing their analysis. However, the InformationTechnologyKnowledgeManagementModelsAgent maintained a probability of 0%, indicating skepticism about the recall without further severe incidents. Overall, experts highlighted increased diplomatic strain but varied in their assessments of whether this would lead to a recall by the forecast's deadline.",
