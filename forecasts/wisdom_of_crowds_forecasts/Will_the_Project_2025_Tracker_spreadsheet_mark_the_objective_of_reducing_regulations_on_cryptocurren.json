The regulation requires providers of cryptoasset services that manage a trading platform to make certain information publicly available, including prices, order books, and transaction data. The regulation also requires the desegregation of pre-trade and post-trade data, and the provision of this data to any interested party upon request. The regulation will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado - BOE](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=DOUE-L-2025-80438)\n\n**Argentina Publishes New Regulation for Cryptocurrency Exchanges**\nThe Argentine government has published a new regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges, following the scandal surrounding the Libra cryptocurrency. The Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (CNV) has created a framework for companies that sell digital assets in Argentina, which includes requirements, obligations, and prohibitions. The regulation aims to ensure transparency, stability, and protection of users in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to the CNV, 'the same has the objective of guaranteeing transparency, stability and protection of users in the crypto ecosystem, imposing obligations in matters of registration, cybersecurity, custody of assets, prevention of money laundering and disclosure of risks.' The regulation includes provisions such as the separation of client assets, requirements for cybersecurity and data protection, and the prohibition of using client cryptocurrencies. The regulation will come into effect on December 31, 2025, and companies that do not comply with the requirements and deadlines will not be able to operate in Argentina. 'We have worked a lot on this norm with the objective of making it effective and comply with the Law, maintaining a balance to not overregulate or impose unnecessary costs on the industry, promoting innovation. This work has been joint with all the actors of the sector, who have made their contributions through the public consultation, which are incorporated in this normative,' said the president of the CNV, Roberto Silva.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 08:23 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/economia/prohibiciones-y-obligaciones-tras-el-escandalo-de-libra-el-gobierno-publico-una-norma-para-regular-nid13032025/)\n\n**Argentina Strengthens Regulations for Cryptocurrency Wallets**\nThe Argentine government has strengthened the requirements for cryptocurrency wallets to operate in the country through Resolution General 1058. The new regulations, which were prompted by a request from the Financial Action Task Force (GAFI), require Providers of Virtual Asset Services (PSAV) to meet additional requirements to continue operating. The regulations aim to prevent Argentina from being added to the GAFI's gray list. The first step was the creation of a PSAV registry, which now has 140 registered companies and 140 in the process of registration. However, the new regulations require registered companies to revalidate their intention to operate by meeting the new requirements. The key points of the regulation include: the deadline for compliance is 1 July 2024 for individuals, 1 August 2025 for local companies, and 1 September 2025 for foreign companies; the deadline for adapting the operational structure is the end of the year; and the regulation and sanctions will come into full effect on 31 December 2025. The National Securities Commission (CNV) can suspend or revoke registrations and unregistered PSAV can be blocked by court order. The regulation was subject to public consultation between October and December 2024 and was not delayed despite the Libra scandal. The government aims to have the regulation in full effect by 2026, giving the industry time to adapt. The regulation is focused on wallets, not cryptocurrencies, and does not include the Solana blockchain or memecoins, which are not considered negotiable assets.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:29 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/03/13/el-gobierno-endurecio-los-requisitos-que-deben-cumplir-las-billeteras-cripto-para-operar-en-la-argentina/)\n\n**Argentina's CNV Publishes New Regulations for Cryptocurrency Exchanges**\nThe Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (CNV) has published the new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges in Argentina. The new rules require providers of virtual asset services to have a minimum net worth, report custody details, comply with cybersecurity and anti-money laundering norms, and have a public relations officer. Additionally, exchanges must list memecoins created within the last 90 days in a special section, warning users of the 'risk of total loss' and 'volatility' associated with this investment. According to CNV, 'the goal is to ensure transparency, stability, and user protection in the cryptocurrency ecosystem', imposing obligations in terms of registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, anti-money laundering, and risk disclosure. Roberto Silva, CNV president, explained that 'we have worked hard on this norm, maintaining a balance to avoid over-regulation and unnecessary costs for the industry, promoting innovation.' The regulation is not related to the LIBRA case, and its timing is not linked to the token promoted by Javier Milei. Currently, 140 entities are registered with CNV, with 131 being legal entities and 9 being individuals. The new regulations will come into effect on December 31, 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:22 PM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/finanzas-mercados/regulacion-cripto-2-0-todos-los-detalles-de-la-nueva-norma-de-cnv/)\n\n**Crypto crackdown: Major exchanges are losing millions over compliance failures - Businessday NG**\nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges have been fined hundreds of millions of dollars in 2025 for failing to comply with financial regulations. Regulators are cracking down on non-compliance, with exchanges facing operational bans, lawsuits, and damage to their reputation. This is a wake-up call for crypto users and businesses, especially in Africa, where digital assets are growing rapidly. Governments worldwide are enforcing compliance, and businesses that fail to follow regulations are facing severe consequences. Exchanges must follow Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, and crypto transactions are being monitored. Non-compliance leads to heavy fines, business shutdowns, and even criminal charges. The future of crypto regulation includes stronger KYC and AML rules, more fines and penalties, and greater clarity in crypto laws. 'Crypto is not beyond the law,' and governments are serious about enforcement.

For other citizens, cryptocurrency transactions may be prohibited, with penalties introduced for violations. The Central Bank reaffirmed that it does not consider cryptocurrency as a means of payment and plans to ban crypto transactions between Russian residents and impose regulatory requirements on financial institutions seeking to invest in digital assets.

The regulations require cryptocurrency service providers to be established as joint-stock companies, have a minimum founding capital of 150 million TL for platforms and 500 million TL for custody institutions, and hold at least 95% of customer assets in custody institutions authorized by the Board. Platforms will only be able to hold 5% of customer assets in-house, and customer cash will be held in accounts opened with banks, monitored separately from the platform's own accounts. The regulations also introduce detailed rules for activities such as buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, initial sales or distributions, custody, and investment advisory, as well as technical requirements such as price monitoring systems and independent audits of information systems. Existing cryptocurrency platforms must apply for an operating license by June 30, 2025, and meet capital adequacy requirements and other obligations by the same date.
