Despite retail sales falling short of expectations, the market showed resilience and rebounded. The Dow Jones was boosted by improved Chinese retail sales and reports that the Chinese government is planning to implement policies to support consumption.

Sector-wise, real estate management and development, and food and household goods retail saw gains, while automobiles and automotive parts saw losses. PepsiCo rose after announcing the acquisition of functional soda brand 'Poppies'. Lululemon Athletica, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Netflix rose due to analysts' upgraded investment recommendations. Affirm fell after announcing that Swedish fintech company Klarna would replace it as the exclusive provider of its buy-now-pay-later service to Walmart. Walmart rose.

According to Reuters. The New York stock exchange showed a positive trend after four brutal weeks, with rising stock prices for the second consecutive trading day. Traders on Wall Street chose to be optimistic and interpreted Monday's news positively. One of the factors was that US retail sales increased by 0.2% in February compared to January, which was significantly lower than some expectations of a 0.6% increase. However, excluding car sales, the increase was 0.3%, which was in line with expectations. Companies such as Walmart and IBM saw significant gains, with increases of 2.5% and 1.9% respectively. Tesla continued its downward trend, falling 4.8%. The company has fallen 40.7% since the start of the year. Factors that have contributed to the uncertainty include President Trump's confusing tariff announcement, a weakening labor market, recession warnings, decreased economic confidence among American households, rising inflation, and global security uncertainty.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 08:09 PM\nSource:[Dagens Nyheter](https://www.dn.se/direkt/2025-03-17/trump-xi-jinping-besoker-usa-inom-kort/)\n\n**Top Retail Stocks To Consider - March 17th**\nMarketBeat's stock screener tool has identified seven retail stocks to watch, including Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Group, Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, and Walmart.

Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $108,786 on the day of Trump's inauguration, has since dropped by 25%. The decline is attributed to investors selling their positions in riskier assets, such as crypto, and moving to safer investments like government bonds. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds has fallen to 4.29%, indicating that investors are shifting their capital to less risky assets. The VIX-index, a measure of market anxiety, has risen to its highest point this year, while Walmart, a key indicator of the US economy, has warned that its expected revenue growth in 2025 will be lower than previously forecast. This has fueled anxiety and uncertainty among investors. Technology stocks, which had driven the market up in 2024, are now showing weakness, with companies like Nvidia, Palantir, and Tesla leading the decline. Meanwhile, European and Chinese markets are performing well, with the STOXX 600 index up nearly 10% this year and Chinese tech stocks rising by over 35% since January. Despite the recent corrections, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 are still higher than they were at Trump's re-election in November. However, the question remains whether the upward trend of 2023 and 2024 can be sustained in 2025, with many investors believing the market is overvalued.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 09:05 PM\nSource:[crypto-insiders.nl](https://www.crypto-insiders.nl/nieuws/bitcoin/bitcoin-en-aandelenmarkt-kelderen-sinds-trumps-rentree-hoe-komt-dit/)\n\n**Investors need to 'bring an umbrella' for rainy days ahead**\nUS stocks are trading lower at the end of a volatile week.

He cites the example of Walmart, whose stock price is around $100 USD, but has a profit per share of $2.67 USD, resulting in a high multiple of 35 times earnings. In contrast, Booking's stock price is around $5000 USD, but has a profit per share of $209 USD in 2025, resulting in a multiple of 24 times earnings. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L'Heureux, a portfolio manager at Valeurs mobili\u00e8res Desjardins, notes that the US market is 'expensive' and vulnerable due to high expectations of profit growth and a list of unaccounted risks, including inflation, economic deceleration, and geopolitical tensions. He also warns that the current multiple of 22 times earnings for the S&P 500 is higher than its historical average of 16.7 times, indicating a 30% premium. 'It has reached levels higher than 22 times only twice since 1996 (during the tech bubble and the pandemic),' says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L'Heureux. 'Tesla is valued at 115 times its profits because there is a lot of enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and what it means for this company,' he adds. 'More than 80% of the value attributed to Tesla by investors is due to products that are not yet commercialized, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/marches/cher-le-marche-boursier-pourquoi-donc/2025-02-23/le-ratio-cours-benefice-comme-guide.php)\n\n**Tesla's Struggles with Electric Car Sales and Musk's Bet on AI and Robotics**\nTesla's automotive division has faced its lowest profitability in five years, with a 13.6% gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from 20-30% in 2020. The company has been actively selling cars at the end of 2024, lowering prices to get rid of excess inventory. However, investors are skeptical that this will help the company in the long term. Despite this, Tesla's stock has risen, with investors focusing on the company's development of artificial intelligence and robotics. Elon Musk has made a bet on these areas, announcing the launch of Tesla Robotaxi in June 2025 and the production of 100 million Optimus robots by 2026. Musk expects the robot market to be worth trillions of dollars, with the Optimus robot alone potentially generating more revenue than Walmart's annual income. However, some investors are concerned that Tesla is losing ground in the electric car market and facing serious problems in its core business.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/auto/2170386-tesla_profit/)\n\n",

As of early 2023, Tesla's market capitalization was higher than Walmart's due to its rapid growth and high market valuations, driven by the tech sector's bullish performance. Historically, companies like Tesla, which are seen as 'high-growth', can experience significant fluctuations in their market capitalizations due to volatility in tech stocks. By comparison, Walmart's market cap is generally more stable due to its status as a retail giant with steady revenue streams. A significant market event, investor sentiment shift, or economic report release affecting either Tesla or Walmart could alter their relative market positions. Given these factors, a reasonable initial probability that Walmart will have a higher market cap than Tesla is based on evaluating the volatility and recent movements in the market caps of high-value companies.

In the second phase, after reviewing recent news of Tesla's stock decline and Walmart's stable performance, all experts increased their probabilities.
