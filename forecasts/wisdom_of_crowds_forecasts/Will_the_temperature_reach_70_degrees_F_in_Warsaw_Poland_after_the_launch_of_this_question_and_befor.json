According to the forecast, temperatures in June and July will exceed the multi-year average. In April, the average temperature will range from 5.3-6.7\u00b0C in Zakopane to 9-9.9\u00b0C in Wroc\u0142aw, with precipitation within the multi-year average, but slightly higher in the north-west and west. May will also see above-average temperatures (up to 14.7\u00b0C) and precipitation. However, the warm summer may lead to drought. The IMGW forecast predicts that June and July will be very hot, with average temperatures exceeding the multi-year average. In June, the average temperature will be around 18.2-18.3\u00b0C in cities like Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw, which is about 1\u00b0C higher than the multi-year average. Fortunately, the forecasted precipitation is within the multi-year average. July is expected to be warmer and slightly more rainy. 'In IMGW-PIB, as well as in other meteorological centers around the world, the average monthly temperature/total precipitation for a given month is forecast in relation to the multi-year average for the period 1991-2020,' explains IMGW on its website.

Not only will it be getting warmer with each passing day, but we can also expect a lot of sunshine. There will be many places where the sky will be completely cloudless for several days, but the lack of precipitation will become a problem in the context of the growing drought. This week, Poland will be taken over by a truly spring-like anticyclone, bringing us exceptional weather that is not common at this time of year. Monday will still be a cloudy day, but more sunshine will be visible in the west and south. The high-pressure weather will accompany us at least until the end of the week, with a large amount of sunshine expected. Until Thursday, clouds will be lingering in the north, but in many other areas, the sky will be completely cloudless. In the second half of the week, it will be the same in the north. Given the current length of the day in Poland, this means that the sunshine will last for up to 11 hours. It's worth using this time for outdoor activities. Considering the growing drought, the lack of precipitation will be a problem. We can expect a very dry week, with little to no precipitation expected in most areas. Only in some northern areas, there may be symbolic precipitation, not exceeding 1 mm. Additionally, we can expect a significant increase in temperature. With each passing day, it will get warmer, and the peak will occur in the second half of the week, when the mercury will rise to 15-18\u00b0C in many regions, with local temperatures reaching 19-20\u00b0C.
