This comprises 34% of total funding, with most of it going to companies that have been around for more than nine years, such as Databricks, OpenAI, and Epic Games. In fact, more than half of all capital from rounds of $500 million or more went to companies more than nine years old. The trend is not limited to giant deals, with 37% of U.S. startup funding last year going to companies currently more than nine years old. This shift is attributed to a lackluster environment for tech IPOs and large acquisitions, with companies opting to stay private and seek capital for expansion and secondary offerings. As one observer noted, 'If the IPO market doesn't pick up later this year, we'll likely see a return to really large private financings for senior startups.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/senior-startups-500m-funding-rounds-ai-av-databricks/)\n\n**Databricks Deepens San Francisco Investment with New Office and Multi-Year Data and AI Summit Commitment**\nDatabricks, a leading Data and AI company, has announced significant investments in San Francisco, including a new, larger headquarters and a multi-year commitment to host its annual user conference, the Data + AI Summit, in the city. The new headquarters, located at One Sansome Street, will offer 150,000 square feet of space for employees, customers, and partners to collaborate and innovate. Databricks plans to invest over $1 billion in its San Francisco operations over the next three years and generate $980 million in additional business value for the city through 2030. The company's commitment to San Francisco is a testament to its confidence in the city as the AI epicenter and its dedication to fostering long-term relationships in the community. As Databricks' Co-founder and VP of Engineering, Patrick Wendell, said, 'San Francisco is quickly becoming the AI capital of the world and we are thrilled to be investing heavily in the city.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[CNW (a PR newswire company)](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/databricks-deepens-san-francisco-investment-with-new-office-and-multi-year-data-and-ai-summit-commitment-845782908.html)\n\n**Microsoft walks away from some Coreweave commitments as $35 bln IPO looms- FT By Investing.com**\nMicrosoft has backed out of some of its commitments to CoreWeave, a data center operator, due to delivery issues and missed deadlines, according to the Financial Times. The move comes as CoreWeave prepares for a $35 billion IPO in April. Microsoft, CoreWeave's biggest customer, had seen strong demand from the tech giant as it ramped up its artificial intelligence offerings. However, a shift in their relationship could impact CoreWeave's prospects, especially with the company's IPO looming. This move may also be linked to Microsoft's recent reduction in demand for data centers and cloud computing services, as reported by TD Cowen in February.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 05:31 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-walks-away-from-some-coreweave-commitments-as-35-bln-ipo-looms-ft-3910914)\n\n**AI\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a Spring 2025: A Conference on the Latest AI Trends and Technologies**\nAIsmiley will host the 'AI\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a Spring 2025' conference on March 27-28, 2025, at the Tokyo Port City Takashiba Office Tower.

This move comes as the US IPO market shows signs of recovery. Discord, founded by Jason Citron in 2015, offers voice, video, and text chat features and has 2 billion monthly active users worldwide. The company had considered going public in 2021 but delayed its plans due to market uncertainty. However, with interest rates decreasing and the US government introducing more favorable policies for the tech industry, Discord is re-examining its IPO plans. According to PitchBook data, Discord was valued at around $150 billion in 2021. The company's IPO plans are still uncertain, but it is not alone in re-examining its IPO plans. Other high-value startups, including Stripe, Chime, and Databricks, have also delayed their IPO plans due to market conditions. Discord initially gained popularity among gamers, individual investors, and cryptocurrency communities before expanding to a broader user base. In contrast, Skype, the pioneer of online calls, will cease service on May 5. Microsoft, which acquired Skype in 2011, will focus on its Teams platform instead. Discord takes a conservative approach to advertising, opting to generate revenue through paid membership features rather than relying on advertising like its competitors Meta, X, and Reddit.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8589479)\n\n**Tech Companies Make Significant Announcements**\nSeveral tech companies have made significant announcements in the past few weeks.

According to The Information, this potential acquisition is happening before CoreWeave's possible IPO, which could value the company at over $20 billion. The acquisition of Weights & Biases would allow CoreWeave to diversify its customer base beyond large clients like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and NVIDIA. Weights & Biases, founded in 2018, offers tools for machine learning to developers and has over 900,000 users, including employees from OpenAI, Siemens, and Salesforce. The company competes with other KI-focused companies like Databricks and Hugging Face.

CoreWeave has raised over $14.5 billion in funding through 12 rounds, including a $7 billion private financing round led by Blackstone and Magnetar in May. Despite concerns about cheaper AI models from DeepSeek and potential cuts to data center leases by Microsoft, Nvidia's recent quarterly results have alleviated concerns about a decline in AI investments. A successful IPO for CoreWeave could encourage other AI companies to move forward with their own IPO plans. 'Many AI companies are waiting for the market window to open further. A successful CoreWeave IPO could get the IPO market going,' said Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital.

Chime Financial offers a financial app that acts like a bank, and it has confidentially filed some IPO paperwork. Klarna is a Swedish buy-now-pay-later leader, and it has filed its confidential paperwork for an IPO. Panera Bread is a bakery-restaurant chain that has been flirting with the idea of going public for a while. The IPO market may fare well in 2025, especially with some hot names on deck, but there are also threats on the horizon, such as President Trump's tariffs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/upcoming-ipos-to-watch-in-2025/)\n\n**They've been waiting years to go public. They're still waiting.**\nMany high-profile startups, including Stripe and Databricks, have opted for private funding instead of going public, despite some companies like Klarna and eToro confidentially filing for IPOs. Turo, a car rental startup, has canceled its listing plans, citing that 'now is not the right time.' The volatile stock market and worsening inflation have created uncertainty and volatility, affecting initial public offerings. IPO advisers and analysts say it's too early to know if macroeconomic concerns will cause other companies to change their plans, but more listings are expected in the second half of the year. 'IPO planning is still very much occurring,' said Rachel Gerring, the IPO leader for Americas at EY. 'We do need to allow a little more time to see where the administration starts to land on some of these key topics that are driving some of the uncertainty,' she added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 04:31 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/theyve-been-waiting-years-to-go-public-theyre-still-waiting-9851268/)\n\n**IPOs: A Dry Well or a Geyser of Capital?**\nDespite the surge in optimism on Wall Street, the attractiveness of the stock market remains a concern for companies going public. According to Renaissance Capital, the number of IPO applications has increased by 33% and 47% for price fixations and prospectus deposits, respectively, but the amount raised has decreased by 4%. Venture Global, the largest IPO of 2025, ended its first trading session down 4% despite lowering its ambitions. Donald Trump's 'Drill, baby, drill' campaign aims to keep prices low for Americans, and Venture Global's $1.8 billion raise, based on a total value of $67 billion, is the largest energy sector IPO in a decade. In contrast, Databricks, a non-listed company, has raised $10 billion in a private funding round, with Meta and sovereign funds participating, valuing the company at $62 billion. Databricks' CEO Ali Ghodsi does not need to be listed to secure funding or ensure liquidity for existing shareholders.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/crible/introductions-en-bourse-puits-et-geyser-2144755)\n\n**3 highly anticipated IPOs that investors should wait for in 2025**\nThe US stock market's bull run is expected to bring growth to select IPO stocks in 2025, making it a good time for US investors to invest. Three highly anticipated IPOs to watch out for are Chime, a fintech company that has raised $750 million in funding and is planning a public debut in 2025, Stripe, another fintech company that could see good growth when it goes public, and Databricks, a data analytics software company that is comparable to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform and is planning to launch its IPO this year. According to the article, 'the report would be quite in favor of US investors' if Chime's year-on-year growth is assessed. However, it's worth noting that there are risks involved with IPO investments, as seen in 2023 and 2024's first half.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 10:21 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/3-highly-anticipated-ipos-that-investors-should-wait-for-in-2025/articleshow/117519406.cms)\n\n**Databricks Secures Record Funding, Valued at $62 Billion**\nDatabricks, a San Francisco-based company, has confirmed that it has closed its previously announced Series J funding round of $10 billion at a valuation of $62 billion. The company has also attracted an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, as well as other 'leading financial institutions and alternative asset managers,' according to a press release. Over its 12-year history, the company has raised around $19 billion in funding (of which $14 billion was in equity capital). Databricks has long been used for large-scale data science projects. For example, companies use this platform to combine and analyze large volumes of data from disparate systems to gain valuable insights. For instance, a retail seller can combine datasets to determine which products are best-selling at different times of the year and predict inventory needs. Recently, Databricks has played an increasingly important role in AI projects. Data plays a crucial role in the burgeoning AI revolution, and Databricks serves as a unified platform for combining and standardizing the structured and unstructured data needed to create and deploy machine learning models. This latest round of Series J, which was first announced in December when Databricks raised $8.6 billion, attracted a number of new and existing investors. In addition to Temasek and QIA (the Qatar state fund), Meta* also supports Databricks as a 'strategic investor.' It is unclear whether Databricks is a Meta client or vice versa. It is worth noting that corporate investments in AI-related companies have become a trend. Last year, Meta and Amazon invested $1 billion in data labeling startup Scale AI. With this additional funding, Databricks has stated that it plans to invest in new AI-based products, strengthen its global operations, and finance new acquisitions. However, the main question now is what happens to Databricks' long-standing plans for an IPO? In December, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said that it would have been 'silly' to go public last year due to elections and a new administration, as well as ongoing economic concerns. He added that 'the earliest theoretical possibility' of an IPO would be in 2025. However, the company has also stated that it is directing some of its new funds towards ensuring liquidity for 'current and former employees,' which suggests that an IPO may occur later.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/bothub/news/876050/)\n\n**Databricks closes $15.3B financing at $62B valuation, Meta joins as \u2018strategic investor\u2019**\nDatabricks, a data analytics platform, has closed a $15.3 billion financing round at a $62 billion valuation, with Meta joining as a 'strategic investor'. The company has raised around $19 billion in financing over its 12-year history. Databricks plans to invest in new AI products, bolster its global operations, and fund new acquisitions. However, the company's IPO plans remain uncertain, with CEO Ali Ghodsi stating that it would be 'dumb to IPO' last year, but also providing liquidity to employees, suggesting an IPO might happen later rather than sooner.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 02:39 PM\nSource:[upstract.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/databricks-closes-15-3b-financing-at-62b-valuation-meta-joins-as-strategic-investor/?ref=upstract.com)\n\n**Databricks Raises $15.25 Billion in Mega-Funding Round**\nDatabricks has finally raised more than $15 billion in funding. The company had announced in December 2024 that it had closed a $10 billion funding round in 'Series J'... However, this new mega-funding round will exceed $15 billion. Databricks has confirmed the finalization of its mega-funding round, totaling $15.25 billion. This amount includes $10 billion in equity financing (Series J, announced in December) - valuing the company at $62 billion - and $5.25 billion in debt financing, provided by JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Meta is among the new investors. The company plans to use the funds to accelerate the development of new AI products, strengthen its international presence, and finance future acquisitions. Databricks also intends to use a portion of the funds to offer liquidity to its current and former employees. This funding round raises questions about the company's potential IPO, which was previously planned for 2025. The fact that Databricks is now offering liquidity to employees suggests that the company may delay its IPO even further.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[informatiquenews.fr](https://www.informatiquenews.fr/databricks-leve-finalement-plus-de-15-milliards-102642)\n\n**Private Capital Gives Largest US Startups Flexibility to Delay IPOs | PYMNTS.com**\nThe largest US startups are raising significant capital in private markets, allowing them to delay initial public offerings (IPOs).

Databricks' CEO Ali Ghodsi said, 'These are still the early days of AI... We are positioning the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to deliver long-term value for our customers.' OpenAI plans to use its $6.6 billion funding to accelerate its mission of developing AGI and expand its computational capacity. This trend is driven by venture firms investing more than usual, with some firms investing many times more than the typical $100 million.

This trend is driven by venture firms investing more than the traditional $100 million, with Databricks' Series J funding round being 'substantially oversubscribed'. Databricks Co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said, 'These are still the early days of AI... We are positioning the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to deliver long-term value for our customers.'

This is due to the flexibility and freedom that comes with being a private company, allowing them to avoid the pressures of public markets. 'We are operating as a public company already,' said Databricks's chief Ali Ghodsi. The largest 15 to 20 start-ups have effectively had their IPOs as private companies, according to Mitchell Green, managing partner of Lead Edge Capital. Private companies are also dodging the scrutiny of public markets, which can be valuable in keeping valuations in check. However, some companies are being pushed onto public markets due to esoteric reasons, such as 'compounding IPO ratchets' or looming stock vesting dates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/b9d7b633-c611-4c09-b02e-5855dfaa0dfb)\n\n**AI Gold Rush and a Billion-Dollar Bet on the Future**\nThe AI investment boom continues, with Databricks securing a valuation of $62 billion after raising $10 billion in one of the largest venture capital funding rounds in history. Seven startups raised rounds of $1 billion or more in 2024, led by Elon Musk's xAI, which raised $6 billion in May Series B funding. OpenAI followed a similar ambitious trajectory, securing $6.6 billion in October 2024, bringing its valuation to $157 billion. The funding rounds show why companies today don't need to go public to raise capital, with Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi saying, 'The earliest theoretical possibility of an IPO would be next year, and then there's lock-up periods, so it would just be too long of a period for employees to get liquidity.' The surge in investment also reflects a critical shift in focus, with investors channeling funds into domain-specific technologies, such as healthcare AI startups like Insilico Medicine and PathAI. Insight Partners attributed generative AI to be the 'major catalyst' in Databricks' growth trajectory. Mega funds and institutional investors, such as SoftBank Vision Fund, have fueled the rise of AI startups with significant capital infusions, and Big Tech is also flexing its financial muscle to invest in well-established AI startups and expand their capabilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[bankinfosecurity.com](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ai-gold-rush-billion-dollar-bet-on-future-a-27230)\n\n",

Despite some initial base probabilities ranging from 20% to 30%, the experts heavily weighted the public statements from Databricks' CEO indicating a reluctance to pursue an IPO in the current market conditions. This led to significant reductions in their final probabilities, with most experts revising their predictions to a 0% likelihood after considering additional news articles in phase 2. The consistent themes in the analysis included unfavorable market conditions, substantial private funding rounds, and strategic decisions to delay going public. Overall, there was no compelling evidence found in the news articles to suggest an imminent IPO announcement, reinforcing the agents' initial assessments.",
