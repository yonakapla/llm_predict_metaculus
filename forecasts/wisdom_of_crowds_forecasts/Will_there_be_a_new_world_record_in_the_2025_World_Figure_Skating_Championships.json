        "description": "[Figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating) is a winter sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on ice while incorporating jumps, spins, lifts, and footwork into choreographed routines set to music. The [World Figure Skating Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships), organised annually by the [International Skating Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union) (ISU) since 1896, represents the most prestigious annual competition in the sport outside the Olympic Games. The [2025 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships) are scheduled to take place in Boston, from March 25 to March 30.\n\nIn all official competitions, athletes are scored using the [ISU Judging System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISU_Judging_System), which consists of two components: the Technical Score (TES) and the Program Components Score (PCS). The Technical Score assesses the difficulty and execution of specific elements (jumps, spins, and step sequences) with each element receiving a base value [ranging](https://www.usfigureskating.org/sites/default/files/media-files/ISU%202656%20ISU_SOV_SinglesPairs_2024-25_final.pdf) from 0.40 to 14, which is then adjusted using a -5 to +5 grade based on the athlete's execution. The Program Components Score evaluates five aspects of the performance: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music, with judges awarding points on a scale of 0.25 to 10.00 in each category.\n\nThe TES and PCS are added together to form the Total Segment Score (TSS), which is calculated for both short programs and free skating and added together to determine an athlete's final ranking.",

The show will feature the national middle school skating competition, where middle school skaters will compete to be part of the Japanese team for the upcoming World Championships. The show will also include interviews with the Japanese team's representatives and a review of the recent Four Continents and World Junior Championships. The show's absence in April means that a review of the World Championships will not be possible. The show's end marks the decline of figure skating-related programs, which will make it harder for non-skating enthusiasts to stumble upon them. However, it's worth noting that figure skaters like Yuzuru Hanyu will still make appearances on variety shows to promote the sport.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[goo blog](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/ico3/e/1ac6c139c2650b0baba5f60dbde5606b)\n\n**Mark Kondratuk: 'I Performed Better in the 2024/25 Season Than in the Olympic Season'**\nMark Kondratuk, the European champion in figure skating, stated that he performed better in the 2024/25 season than in the Olympic season. Kondratuk participated in a show program on the sixth stage of the Moscow Sports Cup. He is a bronze medalist of the 2022 Winter Olympics in the team event, European champion, and winner of the Russian championship. In the 2024/25 season, he took second place in the Russian Grand Prix Final and fifth place in the Russian championship, where he led after the short program. Kondratuk said, 'The season was wave-like. In my subjective opinion, the season went well. There was only one failure in the free program at the Russian championship. Otherwise, the stages went well, the control skates too, the Russian Grand Prix Final, and the jump tournament. If we look at the average level of skating and scores, I performed better this year than in the Olympic season. Therefore, I think everything is fine, and we just need to continue working.' Kondratuk plans to take a break and then attend training camps. He said, 'I would like to go somewhere to rest. I don't know yet where. And then there will be training camps. I don't know yet where and when. But, as usual, there will be training camps and preparation.

Historically, records are often set during Olympic years due to increased competition, but they can also occur at World Championships given the high level of talent. Since multiple score types are considered (TES, PCS, TSS), this increases the possibility for a new world record. On average, a new record in at least one category occurs approximately every 2-3 years during the World Championships based on past events. For instance, recent records in several categories were set in 2019. Based on this historical frequency, a reasonable initial probability that there will be at least one new world record at the 2025 World Championships is around 33%.",
