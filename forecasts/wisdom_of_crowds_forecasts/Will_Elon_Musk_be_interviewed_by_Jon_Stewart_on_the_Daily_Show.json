Lee has expressed his frustration with the current state of politics and the news cycle, calling it an 'unholy mess'. He has also made humorous comments about the likes of Trump and Farage, comparing them to a 'dogshit on the end of a pointed stick' and a 'sausage to fortune' respectively. Lee has also touched on topics such as the environment, culture, and social issues, often using satire and irony to make his points.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/yazar/stewart-lee/2967996)\n\n**Jon Stewart's foul-mouthed attack on Schumer over GOP spending vote**\nJon Stewart criticized Senator Chuck Schumer for supporting the Republican spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Stewart questioned Schumer's decision, saying 'You probably got a little something out of this, didn't you?' and 'Senator Schumer... no disrespect but you are a disgrace to Jewish stereotypes about financial negotiations.' Schumer defended his position, arguing it is essential to fund the government to allow the judicial branch to continue fighting President Trump. He also expressed concerns that a shutdown would allow President Trump and Elon Musk to destroy vital government services. However, some Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, argued that Democrats should not hand Trump a win in Congress and instead go down the obstructionist path. In the end, 10 Democrats voted to break the party's filibuster to advance the bill, and two Democrats supported the bill on final passage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-14512653/Jon-Stewarts-foul-mouthed-attack-Schumer-GOP-spending-vote.html)\n\n**Jon Stewart Tried Out a Similar Joke on Last Night's 'Daily Show' to One 'SNL' Was Forced to Apologize For**\nJon Stewart returned to The Daily Show on Monday, where he roasted Donald Trump and the Democratic Party. Stewart mocked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's unwillingness to battle the Trump agenda and Democratic lawmakers' social media gimmicks. He also joked about a Democratic congresswoman's 'Get Ready With Me' video, which she used to discuss America's healthcare crisis while applying mascara in a car. Stewart deadpanned, 'Obviously that is not meant to diminish Congressman Crenshaw's service, and how he was wounded in Afghanistan making a 'Get Ready With Me' video.' This joke was a nod to Pete Davidson's previous joke about Dan Crenshaw, which sparked a backlash and led to an apology. However, Davidson later walked back the apology, claiming he didn't actually believe he'd done anything wrong. Stewart's joke was likely informed by this history, and he wryly noted, 'Comedy is legal again, right?' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[CRACKED.com](https://www.cracked.com/article_45899_jon-stewart-tried-out-a-similar-joke-on-last-nights-daily-show-to-one-snl-was-forced-to-apologize-for.html)\n\n**Elon Musk takes drastic action against 'baby mama' influencer Ashley St. Clair in court spat over '13th child' | Daily Mail Online**\nElon Musk and 'baby mama' influencer Ashley St. Clair are embroiled in a court dispute over custody of their 13-month-old son. St. Clair, 26, claims Musk, 53, has only met their child three times and has not expressed interest in having custody. Musk's lawyer, Alyssa Rower, has filed a motion to seal the case, which was granted. St. Clair's attorney, Karen Rosenthal, said, 'The courtroom will be closed and the Record sealed. Other than that, I have no comment.' The dispute began when St. Clair sued Musk for sole custody of their son, claiming that Musk was not present for the birth and has not shown interest in having custody. Musk's text messages to St. Clair, obtained in the suit, show him talking about a credible death threat on his life and saying that he wanted to 'knock her up again.' St. Clair responded that she felt their relationship 'broke down' when Musk's fixer and right-hand man Jared Birchall 'got involved.' The case is now sealed, and any hearings will be held behind closed doors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14511403/elon-musk-action-court-ashley-st-clair-court-child.html)\n\n**Jon Stewart on Democrats: 'It's Trump's world and we're just cowering in it'**\nJon Stewart criticized the Democrats' ineffective tactics on The Daily Show, saying 'It is Trump's world and we're just cowering in it'. He mocked Chuck Schumer's plan to reason with Republicans in the gym, saying 'That's your fucking plan? I'm gonna dangle my balls out of my shorts and then... at the gym?' Stewart also joked that 'pedalling really hard and not going anywhere is a great metaphor for the Democratic party right now'. Jimmy Kimmel also took aim at Trump's hypocrisy, saying 'If you scored hypocrisy like golf he'd be 30 strokes under par right now'. Kimmel also joked about Trump's recent interview where he got prodded by a fuzzy microphone, saying 'How funny would it be if that happened every time he was interviewed from here on out?' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/jon-stewart-democrats-trump-world-150142086.html)\n\n**Markus Lanz's Talk Show Guests for March 18, 2025**\nMarkus Lanz's talk show will feature guests Herbert Diess, Ashbrook, and Iwersen on March 18, 2025.

Stewart quipped that Trump is 'like the Make-a-Wish Batman kid' and praised his golf tournament win. However, he focused most of his wrath on Schumer, saying he is a 'disgrace to Jewish stereotypes about financial negotiations' for giving in to the Republicans' demands without asking for anything in return. Stewart also noted that Schumer's plan is fundamentally flawed since Democrats are only polling at 27 percent. He contrasted this with the Republicans' commitment to a 50- to 60-year project to remake the United States. Democratic senator Chris Murphy appeared on the show, but Stewart was skeptical, saying 'What is happening?' as Murphy attempted to explain the situation. Murphy confirmed that he does not agree with the decision of a handful of his colleagues and that this moment requires breaking norms and taking risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jon-stewart-chuck-schumer-democrats-the-daily-show-1235298382/)\n\n**Vance discusses Elon Musk and the economy in NBC News interview**\nVice President Kamala Harris's husband, Doug Vance, discussed Elon Musk's mass firings of federal employees in an interview with NBC News.

He acknowledged that there are 'a lot of good people who work in the government' but also stated that 'some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job.' Vance emphasized the importance of empowering 'great civil servants who are doing important work' and not letting those who don't show up five days a week 'make it harder for us to do what we need to do.' He also discussed the economy, saying that recent lower gas prices are a positive sign and that the 'road ahead of us is long, but we are already starting to see early indications of the president's vision becoming our shared American reality.' Vance denied being overly scripted and emphasized that he tries to say things that are 'in accordance with the president's preferences.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 11:19 PM\nSource:[nbcnews.com](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-acknowledge-elon-musk-mistakes-2028-economy-rcna196509)\n\n**'Daily Show' host Jon Stewart agrees to Elon Musk's demand for...**\nJon Stewart, host of 'The Daily Show', has invited Elon Musk to appear on the satirical program after Musk requested an unedited interview.
