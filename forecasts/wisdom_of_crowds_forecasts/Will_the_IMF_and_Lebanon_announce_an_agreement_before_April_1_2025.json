The agreement has sparked opposition within Argentina. The agreement was ratified by the Argentine Chamber of Deputies with 129 votes in favor and 108 against. The Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, confirmed that the amount of additional financing will be determined by the IMF's directorate, despite earlier statements that the terms were already set. The government has stated that the agreement aims to stabilize the economy and reduce pressure on international reserves, but the responsibility of the debt will fall on future administrations, posing a long-term burden on the Argentine economy. 'We are approving an agreement that has not been celebrated, and we do not know its conditions, how much we will borrow, or how we will borrow it,' said Ana Carolina Gaillard, a deputy from the Uni\u00f3n por la Patria party. The agreement is expected to be finalized by mid-April, with the IMF's directorate meeting to discuss the case in early April.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/programas/econom%C3%ADa/20250320-argentina-y-el-fmi-avanza-el-acuerdo-pero-persisten-dudas-sobre-el-monto-y-las-condiciones)\n\n**Lebanon's Government Prepares for Crucial Moment in IMF and World Bank Negotiations**\nThe Lebanese government is preparing for a crucial moment in its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as the discussion around financial reforms is becoming a central issue. According to 'al-Akhbar', the President of Lebanon, Michel Aoun, and Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, have agreed that any talk of foreign aid is just rhetoric, and that there is no plan for external support without a deal with the 'Arab and international community'. The US is focusing on the role of the World Bank and the IMF, rather than the UN, which has been a point of contention for some. In this context, the search for a new governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon continues, with former presidential candidate Samir Geagea being considered for the position, although it is unclear if he has accepted the offer. The appointment of a new governor and the selection of four deputies to accompany him, scheduled for June, will have a significant impact on several files related to financial and economic reforms. There is also a discussion about amending the laws governing the Central Bank, including the Banking and Credit Law, to introduce some form of oversight over the governor's actions, following the scandals that marred the tenure of former governor Riad Salameh. Additionally, the Ministry of Justice is working on amendments related to the Banking Investigation Authority, linked to files related to the financial and economic situation, both within the Central Bank and with commercial banks. According to 'al-Akhbar', Prime Minister Mikati has tasked Minister of Economy, Amer Bassat, with managing the negotiations with international institutions in the coming phase, effectively handing over the files previously handled by former Deputy Prime Minister, Saad El-Din Al-Shami. Mikati has also asked Bassat to establish a relationship with the Minister of Finance, as the latter will be present in many details, including the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank, not only due to his ministerial position, but also because he represents President Nabih Berri, with whom President Aoun wants to coordinate without any tension.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 02:29 AM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/lebanon/1335786/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A)\n\n**IMF Postpones Decision on Ecuador's Financial Support Until After Presidential Elections**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to postpone its decision on financial support for Ecuador until after the presidential elections on April 13, 2025. This decision reflects the complexity of the country's political and economic scenario and exposes the tensions between international agendas and national interests. The IMF, which has historically influenced the economic policies of developing nations, is now in a cautious observer position, showing clear distrust in the continuity of the current government, whose management has been marked by controversial decisions and growing social discontent. The IMF seems to be waiting to know the next president before committing to new disbursements. Ecuador is under an agreement with the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), signed in April 2024, which includes a $4 billion loan, distributed in several tranches until the first quarter of 2028. However, the next disbursement, valued at $417 million, is suspended due to the IMF's decision to postpone the second review of the program. This review will evaluate the fulfillment of economic goals established until December 2024, but the IMF has made it clear that it will not issue a verdict until after the elections. This decision puts not only financial resources on hold, but also the confidence of international markets in the Ecuadorian economy. For many analysts, this decision is not casual, as the IMF knows that the elections will face two opposing visions: Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, representative of the Citizen Revolution and defender of a more state-led economic model, and the current regime, which has adopted a neoliberal approach aligned with the IMF's demands. However, the president's management has been questioned for its inability to resolve the country's structural problems, such as informality, public service precarization, and poverty increase. The policies pushed under the IMF's umbrella have generated strong criticisms both inside and outside Ecuador, with economists and social organizations denouncing that the emphasis on fiscal adjustment has deepened inequality and exacerbated the difficulties of the most vulnerable sectors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:18 PM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https://www.eldiario.ec/fmi-espera-incertidumbre-economica-politica-futuro-ecuador/)\n\n**Argentine Chamber of Deputies Approves IMF Agreement**\nThe Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved the Decree DNU 179/2025, signed by President Javier Milei, to formalize the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with 129 votes in favor, 108 against, and 6 abstentions. The agreement establishes a 10-year period with a 4-year grace period to allocate funds to settle debt with the Central Bank and pay pending payments to the IMF. However, the DNU does not mention the amount of funds the IMF will disburse or the loan conditions, causing uncertainty in the markets. President Milei celebrated the ratification with a tweet: 'Viva la libertad, carajo'. Meanwhile, a march in support of retirees took place near the Congress, with participation from left-wing organizations and unions, who expressed their rejection of the government's economic policy and the loss of purchasing power suffered by retirees.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:39 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bravotv/el-fmi-requeria-apoyo-politico-y-social-aseguro-ezequiel-orlando-tras-ratificacion-del-dnu.phtml)\n\n**Argentina Approves New IMF Agreement Amid Protests**\nThe Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by a narrow margin, with 129 votes in favor, 108 against, and 6 abstentions. The agreement, proposed by President Javier Milei, aims to secure a 10-year loan with a payment schedule. According to Gabriel Bornoroni, the president of the La Libertad Avanza bloc, 'an agreement is being reached with the IMF without a crisis in Argentina.' The approval comes after a heated session, with exchanges of shouts and insults between government supporters and the opposition. The agreement is expected to provide financial assistance to the country, but in exchange, Argentina will need to implement structural reforms and measures to stabilize its economy. Argentina has been experiencing a positive economic trend, with a fiscal surplus of $1 billion in February and a predicted growth rate of 7.5% in 2025, according to the OECD.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/em-vitoria-para-milei-camara-da-argentina-aprova-novo-acordo-com-fmi/)\n\n**M\u00e1ximo Kirchner Questions IMF Agreement and Warns of Future Government Challenge**\nM\u00e1ximo Kirchner, a member of the Union for the Homeland party, questioned the new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and warned that the next government could challenge its legitimacy and legality. 'The 10th of December 2027, the government that assumes can pose the illegitimacy and illegality of this debt, which is what corresponds', he said from his seat. Kirchner also mentioned that he voted against the agreement in 2022, citing that it did not ensure the sustainability of the debt after 2025. He also criticized the lack of transparency in the agreement, saying 'We should call for reflection and take time because the agreement does not exist'. He also made a reference to the Libra case, which involves the president, saying 'She couldn't identify a scam two centimeters from her nose, and what this Congress is doing today is giving her full powers in an agreement that no Argentine knows'. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/politica/2025/3/19/maximo-kirchner-el-proximo-gobierno-puede-plantear-la-ilegitimidad-este-acuerdo-1195922.html)\n\n**Argentina's IMF Agreement: Key Details and Uncertainties**\nThe Argentine government expects to close a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by mid-April, but there are still unclear definitions on the amounts of new disbursements and conditions. The agreement will include a reduction of the interest rate from 6.46% to 5.63%, resulting in a total savings of $3,000 million. Additionally, there will be a periodic contraction due to the IMF's pardon for countries that have taken debt above their assigned quota. The total savings from interest rates could reach $5,000 million over 10 years. Viceminister Jos\u00e9 Luis Daza stated that 'there is no maximum amount' for the loan, implying that the minimum amount the IMF will lend to Argentina is already agreed upon, which is approximately $9,800 million. The loan will be disbursed in stages, with the first payment being made quickly and directly, and the rest being disbursed upon the fulfillment of quarterly targets. Daza also stated that the 'exit from the ceiling' will depend on the speed of the agreement's liquidation. The agreement aims to pay off capital and strengthen the BCRA's balance sheet by canceling non-transferable bonds without increasing the total debt. The IMF will conduct periodic reviews to authorize disbursements. A law will be passed to support the DNU, which will be included in the 2026 budget project. Javier Milei has committed to Kristalina Georgieva that he will have the possibility of passing his own budget without major criticisms from his allies once the parliamentary composition changes after the October elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/dinero/2025/3/19/acuerdo-fmi-el-trascendental-dato-que-el-viceministro-jose-luis-daza-llevo-al-congreso-1195894.html)\n\n**UNOPS launches the fifth round of Call for Proposals in Lebanon [EN/AR] - Lebanon**\nThe United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) has launched the fifth round of the Call for Proposals in Lebanon, seeking proposals from local non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, foundations, and academic institutions to assist in the operational management and maintenance of Sioufi Garden for 14 months.

According to reports, Rs4.73 per unit of the reduction will be permanent. The government has been able to cut power tariffs due to various measures, including terminating contracts with six Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and converting power purchase agreements with 16 IPPs to a 'take and pay' model. Additionally, the government will utilize the money saved by not decreasing petroleum prices from March 16 to reduce electricity prices by Rs1.30 per unit. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reportedly allowed the Pakistani government to provide relief of Rs250 billion to the masses, provided that petroleum prices continue to decline in the international market. As one official said, 'The money saved by not decreasing the petroleum prices will be utilized to reduce the electricity prices by Rs1.30 per unit.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:57 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/19-Mar-2025/massive-relief-on-electricity-prices-on-the-cards-ahead-of-summers)\n\n**Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's Commitment to Implementing the Taif Agreement**\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's (note: the name of the Prime Minister in the article is 'Najib Mikati' not 'Nawaf Salam') predecessor, Najib Mikati, said, 'We will work on implementing all the provisions of the Taif Agreement and eradicating the evil of sectarianism.' He emphasized that ensuring Israel's withdrawal is a priority, as well as launching a reconstruction workshop in the south, Bekaa, and the southern suburbs of Beirut, and ensuring electricity, negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, judicial independence, administrative reform, equal treatment of depositors, restructuring and attracting investors, and prioritizing the poor families' aid program. He added, 'The absolute priority remains working on rebuilding the state, its institutions, and extending its authority over all Lebanese territories with its own powers, as stipulated in the Taif Agreement.' He also stated, 'We have promised in the government statement to complete the implementation of what has not been implemented from the Taif Agreement, including the National Commission for researching ways to gradually eliminate political sectarianism, as stipulated in Article 95 of the Constitution, to work on eradicating the evil of sectarianism that strikes national life and hinders the ambition of youth to reach a state of law and institutions based on justice and equality among citizens, which relies on academic certificates and competence in public jobs, rather than sectarian identity and political patronage.' He continued, 'We have lost opportunities and we all need to cooperate to succeed in the available rescue opportunities in this new era, so that we are at the level of trust that the Lebanese have given us internally, and our brothers and friends abroad, who will not be stingy with us in support and assistance, if we know how to help ourselves first and foremost.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:17 PM\nSource:[LBCI Lebanon](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/lebanon/844097/lbci-lebanon-articles/ar)\n\n**IMF Expresses Readiness to Support Lebanon in Addressing Economic Challenges**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed its readiness to support Lebanon in addressing its economic challenges. IMF Representative Ernesto Ramirez Rigo said in a statement that he had 'fruitful discussions' with Lebanese officials 'on their policies and reform agenda'. He welcomed the government's request for a new program supported by the IMF to boost its efforts in facing the large economic challenges. Lebanon's economy has been suffering from a 'severe recession, with high rates of poverty and unemployment, since the 2019 crisis', according to the IMF. Ramirez Rigo emphasized that the IMF is 'prepared to support the government's efforts in addressing these challenges' and will maintain close contact with the authorities to help them develop a comprehensive economic reform program that focuses on sustaining public finances and debt, restructing the financial sector, and promoting economic growth. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has called for a unified team to negotiate with the IMF to reach an agreement before the summer. The IMF had announced an initial agreement with Lebanon in April 2022 on a $3 billion assistance plan over four years, but its implementation was conditional on the government's commitment to implement prior reforms, most of which have not been implemented. Ramirez Rigo stated that the measures taken by the government, including stabilizing the exchange rate and reducing inflation, 'are not sufficient to address the ongoing economic, financial, and social challenges'. He added that the IMF is 'prepared to support the government's efforts' and will remain in close contact with the authorities to help them develop a comprehensive economic reform program.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 07:33 PM\nSource:[yementv.tv](https://yementv.tv/2025/03/14/%d8%b5%d9%86%d8%af%d9%88%d9%82-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d9%82%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d9%88%d9%84%d9%8a-%d9%84%d8%a8%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%84-%d9%8a%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a.html)\n\n**Lebanon's Dollar Price Remains Stable Amid IMF Negotiations**\nThe price of the US dollar against the Lebanese pound remained stable on Friday, March 14, 2025, amidst calm trading in the official and parallel markets. A new round of negotiations between the Lebanese government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation, led by Ernesto Ram\u00edrez Rigo, aimed to achieve progress towards a final agreement that would grant Lebanon a loan. According to financial expert Walid Abu Suleiman, 'The agreement signed in April 2022 serves as the basis for any new agreement, but it requires the implementation of reforms such as auditing the accounts of major banks, enacting capital control, unifying the exchange rate, and restructuring debt. The expansion of the 'cash economy' and Lebanon's accession to the gray list have added complexity to the scene, especially since the IMF emphasizes combating money laundering.' The IMF prioritizes debt sustainability over granting the loan and requires the implementation of reforms, including combating corruption, reducing tax evasion, and balancing the budget, which remains unrealistic, especially after the recent Israeli aggression and resulting losses. Regarding the proposal to 'wipe out deposits,' Abu Suleiman explained that it involves a fair distribution of losses according to a predetermined hierarchy, calling for auditing financial accounts to distinguish between suspicious and clean money. The possibility of Lebanon requesting an increase in the loan to $9 or $10 billion was discussed, but the IMF will not agree without significant reform steps, such as restructuring the public and banking sectors, combating customs and tax evasion.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 08:22 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/dollar-price-in-lebanon-friday-14-2025)\n\n**Aoun Urges Cooperation to Reach IMF Agreement Before Summer**\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun emphasized the importance of controlling public spending and following up on financial and economic reforms during a cabinet meeting on Thursday. Aoun pointed out that a 2025 budget was signed during the previous meeting and stressed the need to monitor public spending according to Article 118 of the Public Accounting Law. He asked the Finance Minister to submit a quarterly report to the government on the status of public spending, allowing for effective implementation of the budget. In an effort to achieve economic and financial stability, Aoun announced the formation of a committee chaired by the Finance Minister and including the Economy Minister, the acting Governor of the Central Bank, two advisors, and a special advisor to the Prime Minister, Mia Mbeidat. The committee will follow up on the points discussed by the International Monetary Fund delegation during its visit to Lebanon. Aoun emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer, stressing that this path requires cooperation between all authorities and parties in the country to restore internal and external trust, which is a basic condition for economic reform. He also mentioned the IMF's demands, which include the appointment of a new Governor of the Central Bank and the establishment of a unified data center (data center) at the Ministry of Finance. The IMF delegation emphasized the need to pass two essential laws: a revised banking secrecy law and a law to restructure the banking sector, which is a crucial step in the process of reforming the banking sector and restoring confidence in the Lebanese financial system.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[LebanonDebate](https://www.lebanondebate.com/news/689299)\n\n**Lebanon Begins Negotiations with IMF for New Agreement**\nLebanon has begun negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reach a new agreement. According to 'Nidaa Al-Watan', the IMF delegation informed Lebanese officials that the window for cooperation with the Lebanese government has a limited timeframe, and the IMF has other priorities in the region. The IMF has given Lebanon until the end of April to meet with the World Bank. The IMF has proposed a plan for Lebanon to exit its economic and financial crisis through a comprehensive reform program. The plan includes the privatization of some state-owned institutions, which is a natural step in the agreement with the IMF. The IMF has not explicitly stated that privatization is a condition for the agreement, but it is a likely outcome of the IMF's austerity policies. The IMF has been criticized for its policies, which aim to weaken public financing and the workforce in the public sector. The Lebanese government has expressed its commitment to implementing reforms, and President Michel Aoun has met with the IMF delegation to discuss the plan.

According to a statement from the Ministry of Finance, the announcement came after a meeting between Jaber and the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo. Jaber described the meeting as 'good' and 'transparent'. Lebanon has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2019, when its financial system collapsed under the weight of state debt. The country failed to make payments in 2020 and ordinary depositors were denied access to their savings. In 2022, Beirut reached a draft 'financing agreement' with the IMF, but it was conditional on reforms that were not implemented. Jaber said, 'I expressed the government's commitment to implementing all necessary reforms. Not because anyone asked us to, but because the country needs these reforms.' He did not provide details of the agreement, but said the government is responsible for developing a new plan with the IMF. He added that the government has presented its priorities for the next phase to the IMF, including the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank. Jaber said that the IMF will visit Lebanon again in early April if a new governor is appointed.

According to Dr. Anis Bou Diab, an economic expert and member of the Economic and Social Council, the agreement will include the implementation of a new budget for 2024 and the preparation of a draft budget for 2025 that meets the IMF's requirements. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new fund to support the Lebanese economy, as well as the implementation of reforms to address the country's financial crisis. Bou Diab stated that the agreement will be a significant step towards resolving the country's financial crisis and will help to restore confidence in the Lebanese economy. However, the agreement will require the government to take responsibility for its financial obligations and to work with the IMF to implement the necessary reforms. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new mechanism for the distribution of losses among the banks and the government. Bou Diab emphasized that the agreement will not be a condition, but rather a requirement for Lebanon to access the IMF's funds. He also stated that the agreement will not include the cancellation of deposits, but rather a collaborative effort between the government and the banks to find a solution to the problem. The agreement will also include the establishment of a new capital control law, which will allow the government to control the flow of capital in and out of the country. Bou Diab concluded that the agreement will be a significant step towards resolving the country's financial crisis and will help to restore confidence in the Lebanese economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 10:02 AM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/lebanon/1329311/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%8A%D9%83-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%9F)\n\n**EU Announces 500 Million Euros in Aid to Lebanon with Conditions**\nThe European Union has announced that it will provide 500 million euros in aid to Lebanon, but with conditions.

The IMF and the World Bank are interested in participating in a workshop for the reconstruction of the damaged areas in Lebanon, especially with the expected visit of an IMF delegation after the formation of the new government. According to Dr. Naseeb Gabriel, an economist and head of the economic and financial research department at Bank Byblos, the World Bank has provided loans to Lebanon in the past, but they were small. Gabriel participated in a meeting held on November 27, 2024, where the World Bank's director spoke about the bank's intention to fund a reconstruction workshop. Gabriel quoted the director as saying, 'Firstly, we can redirect part of the loans we previously provided to Lebanon to cover the costs of reconstruction, as we did in other countries and in similar cases... Secondly, even if the World Bank decides to fund part of the reconstruction directly or indirectly, it cannot give large loans because the public debt in Lebanon is still high compared to the national income, and the Lebanese government has not yet started the required negotiations with the holders of the 'Eurobonds', therefore, Lebanon should rely more on donations rather than loans.' As for the expected financial support from the IMF, Gabriel reminded that the IMF delegation visited Lebanon in May 2024 and announced that the initial agreement signed between the Lebanese government and the IMF on April 7, 2022, had expired and needed to be updated, not only in terms of numbers but also in its content. Therefore, according to Gabriel, the work on this agreement has stopped, and the IMF is waiting for the election of a new president in Lebanon and the formation of a new government, which will then send a delegation to the IMF to inform them of the new government's demands regarding the economic and financial situation in Lebanon. Gabriel emphasized that the new government will return and reopen channels of communication with the IMF to present a new reform program, which he hopes will be different from the current government's program and will actually negotiate with the IMF, rather than asking for loans. Gabriel explained that the IMF is a bank that lends billions of dollars to countries and its priority is to ensure that the borrowing country pays back the loans on time according to a predetermined schedule. Today, the IMF is waiting for each country to present its plan for discussion with the relevant authorities in the country, and according to Gabriel, the IMF's priority is to ensure that there is a broad consensus within these authorities to adopt this plan, so that it can be presented to the IMF for approval. Gabriel added that the IMF puts pressure on certain countries to reduce their other financial commitments, such as public debt, because its priority is to ensure that the borrowing country pays back the loans on time. In the case of Lebanon, the IMF considers that any agreement with it will open the door for Lebanon to borrow from other multi-lateral financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank. The IMF monitors the progress of the procedures agreed upon with the borrowing country, both before and after the loan is disbursed. The more the borrowing country meets the required standards, the more the IMF releases part of the funds covered by the loan.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 02:19 PM\nSource:[almarkazia.com](https://almarkazia.com/ar/%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%91%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%91-1)\n\n",
