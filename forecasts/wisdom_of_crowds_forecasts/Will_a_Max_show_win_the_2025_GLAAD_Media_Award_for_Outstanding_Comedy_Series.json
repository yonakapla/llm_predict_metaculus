        "description": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\" of the LGBT community, \"Boldness and Originality\" of the project, significant \"Cultural Impact\" on mainstream culture, and \"Overall Quality\" of the project. Results are then certified by a \"Review Panel\" who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own \"expert opinions\".\"",

The series, starring Colin Farrell, has won several precursor awards and is a strong bet to win. Other contenders include Kevin Kline, Robert De Niro, and Brian Tyree Henry. However, recent history has shown that the limited series race can be unpredictable, and underdog contenders like 'Adolescence' newcomer Cooper or Jake Gyllenhaal for 'Presumed Innocent' could surprise. In the TV movie category, 'Rebel Ridge' and 'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy' are leading the pack, but it's been a while since the Emmys TV movie category was awarded during the Primetime Emmy Awards broadcast. 'The Penguin' stars Cristin Milioti and Colin Farrell are also leading the movie/limited series acting races. As Emmy winner Richard Gadd said, 'Baby Reindeer became one of last year's most widely seen shows, and when the Emmy Awards announced its winners in the limited series and movie categories in September, Gadd, Gunning, and Baby Reindeer won.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/outrageously-early-emmy-odds-penguin-150059324.html)\n\n**'Jury Duty' To Return For Season 2 On Amazon; Theme Of New Installment Revealed**\nThe Amazon Freevee comedy 'Jury Duty' is returning for a second season on Prime Video.

In phase 2, after reviewing news articles about award nominations and ongoing recognition for Max shows like 'Hacks,' experts adjusted their probabilities, resulting in a revised probability range of 30% to 75%. 'Hacks' was highlighted as a strong contender due to its accolades at other major award events, reinforcing its chance of winning the GLAAD award. However, strong competition from other shows remains a factor, slightly moderating the probabilities.",
