        "description": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\" of the LGBT community, \"Boldness and Originality\" of the project, significant \"Cultural Impact\" on mainstream culture, and \"Overall Quality\" of the project. Results are then certified by a \"Review Panel\" who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own \"expert opinions\".\"",
