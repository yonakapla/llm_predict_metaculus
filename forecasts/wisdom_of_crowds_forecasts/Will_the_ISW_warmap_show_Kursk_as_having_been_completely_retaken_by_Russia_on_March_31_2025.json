Ukraine may be forced to cede more land to Russia, with the country's forces fearing a potential invasion of the Sumy province. A spokesperson for Ukraine's state border guard stated, 'These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes.' The US has stopped providing Ukraine with real-time intelligence, including combat surveillance and reconnaissance data, which had been crucial in helping Kyiv navigate Russian assault. Russian forces are deploying 'fibre-optic drones,' which operate via high-speed cables immune to electronic jamming, making battlefield conditions more challenging for Ukraine. The US is pushing Ukraine toward peace talks with Russia, with Washington hoping to secure a ceasefire along the existing frontlines and pressure Kyiv to accept Russian occupation of its seized areas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:10 PM\nSource:[tfiglobalnews.com](https://tfiglobalnews.com/2025/03/12/kursk-almost-retaken-putins-forces-now-eye-sumy/)\n\n**Abandoned Ukrainian Equipment in Kursk Region to be Sent to Scrapyard and Exhibitions**\nAccording to Colonel Timur Sirtlanov, a member of the 'O\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438' organization, more than half of the abandoned Ukrainian military equipment in the Kursk region will be sent to the scrapyard and used as exhibits on displays. 'Some of the equipment will be sent to the scrapyard, while others can be repaired and displayed on exhibitions - in Moscow's Park Patriot, and on Poklonnaya Gora, and also on the memorial in Ponyri, where there is already an open-air exhibition of NATO equipment,' Sirtlanov said. He also believes that the abandoned NATO equipment should not be displayed on the Victory Day parade on May 9. 'I think it's not worth showing this equipment on the parade. We should show the achievements of the Russian military-industrial complex and the faces of our people, the winners, not the negative advertising of foreign arms and military equipment. It's better to show it on exhibitions and tell how well it works and how to destroy it,' Sirtlanov added. Russian troops have begun to transport the abandoned Ukrainian equipment from the Sudzhansky district, where Ukrainian soldiers left it in large quantities when they fled from the liberated settlements. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the city of Sudzh on March 13, 2025, and Russian troops have almost completely cleared the Kursk region of the enemy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/syrtlanov-broshennaya-tehnika-vsu-v-kurshchine-poydet-na-metallolom-i-vystavki)\n\n**Russian Soldier Describes Devastation in Occupied Village**\nA Russian soldier, known by the call sign 'Blin', reported that the village of Rus\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 in the Kursk region, which was occupied by Ukrainian forces (VSU) since August 2024, has been almost completely destroyed. 'They turned everything into a fortified position. There will be more cattle than people there. They were even shooting cows and pigs,' Blin said. He added that he saw VSU troops setting up a weapons depot in one of the houses and that they had fortified their positions in almost all residential buildings. The village is now empty of civilians. According to a former head of the Sudzhansky district, Andrei Bogachev, the villages of Malaya Loknya, Martynovka, and Cherkasskoye Porichno have also suffered significant damage, with around 60% of their buildings destroyed. The town of Sudzh, liberated on March 13, has been damaged to the tune of around 40%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:44 AM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/03/18/rossiyskiy-voennyy-rasskazal-o-polnostyu-razrushennom-vsu-sele-v-kurskoy-oblasti/)\n\n**Russian Forces Continue to Push into Kursk Region, ISW Reports**\nThe Russian army continues to attempt to fully expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. According to Russian sources, on March 17, the Russian army allegedly captured Gogolevka and advanced south of the settlement. Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provided an update on the situation in Kursk over the past 24 hours. Apty Alaudinov, commander of the 'Akhmat' group, stated that the Russian army has made gains in an unspecified area of the Sumy region, aiming to create a buffer zone after Ukrainian forces are fully removed from Kursk. Footage with geolocation from March 16 and 17 shows Russian forces advancing in the areas of Kurylovka, Guvevo, and Gogolevka in Kursk, as well as in the area of Basyovka in Sumy. Andriy Demchenko, a representative of the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service, reported that small enemy reconnaissance groups are attempting to attack Ukrainian forces in the areas of Novenky and Zhuravka. ISW analysts noted the presence of Russian 177th Marine Battalion units in the Guvevo area. Additionally, analysts reported that on the night of March 17, drones attacked an oil refinery in the Astrakhan region. Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, stated that one of Russia's fuel storage facilities was hit. The governor of Astrakhan Oblast, Igor Babushkin, confirmed a fire at the refinery. As previously reported by Dialog.UA, analysts from DeepState discussed the situation in the Zaporizhzhia region near Malysheve.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:21 AM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/war/311068_1742270986)\n\n**Russian Forces Continue Ground Operation in Kursk Region, Make Progress in Toretsk**\nOn March 17, 2025, Russian forces continued their ground operation to push Ukrainian forces out of occupied positions in the Kursk region. The enemy claimed to have captured the village of Gogolevka, but ISW analysts found no confirmation. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to attack, trying to advance into the Sumy region. In the Kharkiv region, Russian forces continued to launch attacks on the north, but made no progress. They also attacked near Kupiansk, but again made no gains. In the Donetsk region, Russian forces continued to launch attacks on the North, East, and South, but the front line remained unchanged. However, on the Toretsk direction, both Ukrainian and Russian forces made progress. Ukrainian forces advanced in Toretsk, while Russian forces advanced south of Leonidovka. Heavy street fighting continues in Toretsk, with Russian and Ukrainian positions often just a few houses apart. Russian forces also made progress in the direction of Velika Novoselka, advancing south of Privolnoe. In the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces continued to advance, capturing the center of Malyshevbaky. However, on the Kherson direction, the enemy is not conducting active offensive operations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:56 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/ru/karty-isw-17-marta-2025-gde-prodvigajutsja-rossijane-imejut-li-uspeh-vsu-novosti-ukrainy-24-kanal_n2777993)\n\n**Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from Kursk After Failed Operation**\nThe Ukrainian forces in Kursk have withdrawn from the region after a failed operation. The Russian army has retaken the territory, and the Ukrainian forces are now in a defensive position. The operation, which began on August 6, 2024, was meant to push the Russian forces back, but it ultimately failed. The Ukrainian forces were unable to hold their ground due to a combination of factors, including the lack of support from the US, the failure of their own military strategy, and the effective use of Russian drones to attack their supply lines. The US President, Donald Trump, had suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 3, 2025, which some experts believe may have contributed to the Ukrainian defeat. However, the NYT reports that the Ukrainian forces were not encircled and that their losses were relatively low. The Russian army has suffered significant losses, with an estimated 40,000 casualties, including 16,000 killed. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has acknowledged that the operation was a failure and that the Ukrainian forces are now in a defensive position. 'We couldn't allow expensive rockets to be fired at the wrong target,' said Andrii, a Ukrainian officer. 'It was a mix of organized and chaotic withdrawal,' said Boroda, the commander of the Ukrainian forces. 'Various factors influenced the withdrawal: fatigue, good or bad orders from individual commanders, communication breakdowns - or good coordination.' The situation in Kursk is now stable, and the Ukrainian forces are preparing to defend their remaining territory.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 05:16 PM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/hat-trump-die-ukraine-in-kursk-verraten-was-dafuer-spricht-und-was-dagegen-2608199.html)\n\n**'Horror everywhere': In Kursk, evacuated Russians long for peace**\nRussia has evacuated 371 civilians from the Kursk region, which was recently retaken from Ukraine. Many of the towns in the area have been left in ruins by the fighting. One evacuee from Martynovka reported that the Ukrainian soldiers treated them kindly, saying, 'The Ukrainian soldiers did not hurt us. They treated us kindly.' The evacuation comes after Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in August 2024, trapping Russian civilians in the area.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:59 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250317-horror-everywhere-in-kursk-evacuated-russians-long-for-peace)\n\n**Russian Ministry of Defense Releases Video of Abandoned Ukrainian Positions in Kursk Region**\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has released a video showing abandoned positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) in the Kursk region, including equipment and ammunition. The footage, published on March 17, 2025, in the Telegram channel of the defense ministry, shows the locations of Ukrainian units near the liberated settlements of Kosi\u00e7a and Cherkaske Porichne. The video features burned-out enemy equipment, Western ammunition and weapons, including a Ukrainian-made hand grenade launcher designed by American blueprints, Czech grenade launchers and machine guns, a Swedish hand grenade launcher, a Singaporean grenade launcher, and a Javelin anti-tank missile system. Russian soldiers also showed new drones that the VSU had not had time to use. As explained by a Russian sniper with the call sign 'Luna', the VSU lost support from their drones when Russian forces pushed them out of the forest, making it easier to advance to the settlements. Earlier on March 17, the Ministry of Defense released a video showing the 'Rubicon' center's FPV drones striking VSU equipment and personnel in the Kursk border area. The footage suggests that Russian forces had eliminated clusters of personnel, tanks, vehicles, including an American high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) and a quad bike. According to IA Regnum, on March 14, the 'Rubicon' center's FPV drones struck VSU columns leaving the Kursk border area. On the same day, it was reported that over the past week, Russian forces had liberated 28 settlements in the Kursk region, including Sudja, Viktorovka, Nikolaevka, Staraya Sorochina, Lebedevka, Kosi\u00e7a, Mala Loknya, Cherkaske Porichne, Agro, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitriykov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kubatkin, Kolmakov, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, Yuzhny, Kazachya Loknya, Pervy Knyazhiy, Vtoroy Knyazhiy, Zamostye, Mirovny, Podol, Melovoy, Goncharovka.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 10:37 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 - \u0418\u0410 REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/news/3953807)\n\n**Chaos and Attempts to Flee: Situation in Kursk Region on March 17**\nThe liberation of the Kursk region is ongoing, with Russian forces pushing out the remaining Ukrainian troops, according to NEWS.RU. As of the morning of March 17, intense battles are taking place near the Sudoga-Yunakivka road, where abandoned foreign equipment remains. Russian forces have already cleared several Ukrainian positions and are securing objects. In the Gogolevka area, Ukrainian troops have been largely pushed out, with a final sweep of the area still underway. Ukrainian soldiers are abandoning their equipment and attempting to flee before Russian troops arrive, according to the head of a motorized rifle battalion. The commander showed footage of abandoned equipment, including Czech grenade launchers, Swedish vehicles, and an American Javelin missile system. It appears that the Ukrainian military is unable to demonstrate its own capabilities, with all equipment provided by Western 'partners' in Kyiv. Another video from a soldier with the call sign 'Luna' shows anti-tank mines and HIMARS rocket systems, which were allegedly used by Right Sector fighters. Military sources note that many mercenaries from South America are among those fighting in the Kursk region, with many sergeants among them. These foreign fighters are primarily serving in blocking detachments. Interestingly, Ukrainian soldiers who extract foreign fighters from the battlefield are promised a green card by the Americans, which has greatly motivated the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, American media is reporting that Ukrainian forces have largely withdrawn from the Kursk region, thanks to the efforts of the Russian army, which is showing impressive successes on the battlefield. It is reported that by the end of the week, Ukrainian troops will be limited to just 77 square kilometers. Ukrainian soldiers describe their retreat as chaotic, with Russian forces breaking through their positions unexpectedly. Additionally, it has been reported that Ukrainian troops are being trained on the rules of behavior in captivity by the Russian military. 'Instructors of the training course acknowledged that most Ukrainian soldiers were forcibly mobilized, and at the first opportunity, they will surrender to captivity, where they will not reveal any additional information,' the message reads.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 09:15 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/03/17/khaos-i-popytki-ukraincev-sbezhat-situaciya-v-kurskoy-oblasti-na-utro-17-marta.html)\n\n**Ongoing Battles in Kursk Region as Russian Forces Push Back Ukrainian Occupation**\nIntense battles are ongoing along the road from Sudzha to Yunakovo in the Kursk region, which is known as the 'road of death'. According to the Telegram channel 'Severny Vetyer', close to the 'Sever' military group, Russian forces have been pushing back Ukrainian forces, capturing several key positions and securing the area. The channel reports that Russian troops are nearing complete liberation of the Sudzha border area from Ukrainian occupation. While Russian forces have cleared most of Gogolevka and are finishing the cleanup of the surrounding area, the village has not yet been fully liberated. Sudzha was liberated in March 2025, after being occupied by Ukrainian forces for seven months. The Ukrainian invasion began in August 2024, with the goal of reaching the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, but Russian forces prevented them from doing so. As reported by the acting governor of Kursk region, Alexander Khinsteyn, on March 14, Ukrainian forces had previously attacked the local history museum in Sudzha, resulting in the death of a museum employee who had returned to the city during the occupation.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 06:34 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/54358820-sv-pod-kurskom-vdol-trassy-sudzha-yunakovka-prodolzhayutsya-ozhestochennye-boi/)\n\n**Russia Retakes Zaole\u015fenka and Ruban\u015f\u00e7ina Settlements from Ukraine**\nAccording to a statement from the Russian government, Russian forces have retaken the settlements of Zaole\u015fenka and Ruban\u015f\u00e7ina in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces.

In areas cleared of Ukrainian soldiers, mine clearance operations have been initiated. Additionally, it was stated that 126 Ukrainian drones were shot down by Russian air defense systems over Russian territories, including the Moscow region. This comes after Russia's Defense Ministry announced on March 14 that Russian forces had retaken 29 settlements in the Kursk region over the past week. US President Donald Trump had previously called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers trapped in the Kursk region. Putin responded by saying, 'Their lives will be guaranteed if they lay down their arms and surrender.'

President Vladimir Putin has instructed his commanders to eject the last Ukrainian troops as soon as possible, saying they would have to 'surrender or die'. Russian military blogger Yuri Podolyaka said fighting was taking place in the Ukrainian settlements of Basivka and Zhuravka. Ukrainian border guard spokesman Andriy Demchenko said small Russian assault groups were still trying to cross the border and push towards Novenke and Zhuravka, and Ukraine was using all available weapons to repel them. Russia has been largely absent from Ukraine's Sumy region since April 2022, when they withdrew from the border province to refocus their forces on eastern Ukraine.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/russia-says-it-retakes-another-village-in-drive-to-push-ukraine-out-of-kursk/2548241/)\n\n**Russia Announces Retaking of Gon\u00e7arovka Settlement from Ukraine**\nRussia announced that it has retaken the Gon\u00e7arovka settlement in the Kursk region from Ukraine.

Marochko also suggested that Ukraine will have no leverage in future negotiations due to the impending liberation of the Kursk Region, saying 'Kiev will have no trump card in the form of the Kursk Region at negotiations [between Russia, the United States and Ukraine] because the region will be liberated soon.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 03:23 AM\nSource:[TASS](https://tass.com/defense/1927967)\n\n**Russia Retakes City, Expels Ukrainian Troops from Kursk**\nRussia has retaken the city and expelled Ukrainian troops from Kursk. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated, 'We defeated the Ukrainians in the shortest possible time.' The occupied Russian territory is seen as a potential bargaining chip in negotiations with Russia, which has already taken 20% of Ukraine's territory. The US and Ukraine proposed a 30-day ceasefire, during which a more permanent peace agreement would be negotiated. A US delegation arrived in Moscow to present the proposal to the Russian government. In response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminum, Canada announced it will impose new tariffs on American products, including computers and sports equipment, starting today.

As a result, our troops are moving to more advantageous positions as needed, and some units are withdrawing from Kursk Oblast.' This implies that some Ukrainian forces may be withdrawing from the region, which could be a setback for Ukraine's future negotiations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 09:40 AM\nSource:[NHK\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250313/k10014748911000.html)\n\n**Russia Announces Final Phase of Military Operation in Kursk Region**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has announced that the operation to retake the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces is entering its final phase, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov.

Thus, historically, such changes in control are relatively infrequent within short periods (e.g., weeks).

The initial probabilities ranged from 10% to 55%, with factors such as Russian military capabilities, Ukrainian resistance, international support, and logistical challenges influencing the forecasts. In Phase 2, after reviewing news articles indicating Russian advances in Kursk, experts generally increased their probabilities. Revised probabilities ranged from 35% to 70%, with reports of significant Russian progress and Ukrainian withdrawals reinforcing the likelihood of a Russian retake, while ongoing resistance and lack of independent confirmation posed challenges to complete control. Ultimately, experts showed increased confidence in a potential Russian retake of Kursk by the deadline, but highlighted uncertainties due to ongoing battles and geopolitical dynamics.",
