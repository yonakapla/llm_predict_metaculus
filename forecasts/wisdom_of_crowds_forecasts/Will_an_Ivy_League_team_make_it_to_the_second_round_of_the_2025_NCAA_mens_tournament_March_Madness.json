The team's offensive struggles were on display, with a season-low 56 points scored against Brown and 57 points scored against Yale. Junior guard Xaivian Lee was a bright spot, scoring 19 points against Yale. Head coach Mitch Henderson expressed concerns about the team's consistency, saying, 'We have a problem on our team.' The team's title hopes are fading, and they are now tied for third place in the Ivy League standings with only one game separating them and fifth-placed Brown.
