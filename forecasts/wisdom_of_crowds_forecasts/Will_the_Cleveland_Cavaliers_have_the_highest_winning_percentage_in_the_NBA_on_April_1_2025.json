Despite this, the team remains confident, having proven they can win tough games without Mitchell. With De'Andre Hunter expected to return to the lineup, the Cavs will have some reinforcements as they take on the Memphis Grizzlies. The game's availability could decide the Defensive Player of the Year award, with Evan Mobley and Jaren Jackson Jr. facing off in a marquee showdown. Mobley has been vocal about his goals this season, including winning Defensive Player of the Year, and this game could serve as his opportunity to cement his claim as the league's best defender.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 08:02 PM\nSource:[ClutchPoints](https://clutchpoints.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/cavs-news-cleveland-winning-streak-donovan-mitchell)\n\n**Nikola Jokic Returns to the Top of the MVP Hunt**\nThe NBA has updated the 'MVP Hunt' for the 2024/25 season. Nikola Jokic returned to the top spot after a historic triple-double (31+21+22) and a win against Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Cleveland Cavaliers continue their winning streak (15 games in a row). Leader Donovan Mitchell rose to the Top 5, while forward Evan Mobley entered the top 10 this week.
