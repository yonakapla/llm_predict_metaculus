A brush fire in southern Miami-Dade has forced the closure of Card Sound Road, and the wind will play a role in determining where the smoke will move. Rain is not expected to help with the containment of the fire, and it will be mainly dry and sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 80s. There is a moderate risk of rip currents along the Atlantic beaches. Thursday will be the warmest day of the week, with highs in the mid 80s, but it will be breezy.

'The temperature will be above 10 degrees Celsius on March 23 and 24, with daytime temperatures ranging from +6 to +11 degrees Celsius. It will be sunny due to high pressure, and the air masses will be moving from the south,' Vilfand said. He added that on March 25, daytime temperatures are expected to range from +9 to +14 degrees Celsius, with mostly clear skies and little precipitation. 'There will be plenty of sunshine in the coming days, and if you stand outside for an hour, you might even get a sunburn,' Vilfand concluded. This comes after Tatyana Pozdnyakova, the chief specialist at the Moscow Meteorological Bureau, predicted that April will be 3 degrees warmer than normal in Moscow. Vilfand also previously stated that spring 2025 temperatures will be within or slightly below normal, and that the winter of 2024-2025 was the second warmest on record.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1856652/2025-03-19/vilfand-sprognoziroval-do-14-gradusov-tepla-v-moskve-na-sleduiushchei-nedele)\n\n**What will weather be like during Easter school holidays in Scotland as experts tease 'hottest ever' April - Daily Record**\nExperts predict that this April could be the 'hottest ever' in the UK, with a 20% chance of it being the planet's hottest ever April. The Met Office's long-range forecast suggests that it will be dry with average temperatures, but there is a possibility of wetter episodes. Daytime maximum temperatures are expected to be around 11C, but some experts believe it could reach 27 degrees in parts of the UK. However, there is also a 17% chance of it being the UK's wettest ever April.

'All seasonal weather forecast models are unanimous in their calculations: a positive temperature anomaly will persist in April, averaging around +3\u00b0C. This means that the mean monthly temperature will exceed +10\u00b0C,' she wrote in her Telegram channel. Podynyakova notes that April this year will be similar to April 2024 in terms of temperature. However, the forecast for precipitation is uncertain, with both a deficit and an excess being equally likely. Last year, April saw an excess of precipitation, with 37 mm of normal precipitation exceeded by 130-150%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/03/19/reg-cfo/sinoptik-pozdniakova-v-aprele-anomalno-teplaia-pogoda-v-moskve-sohranitsia.html)\n\n**April 2025: Temperatures Above Average, but Extreme Weather Events Possible**\nAccording to the latest updates, April 2025 is expected to start with temperatures above the average, with deviations of +2-3\u00b0C from the reference values on most of Europe's central and eastern regions, as well as Scandinavia. Italy is also expected to experience temperatures above the average, with deviations of +1 to +3\u00b0C from the mean. However, this does not mean that there will be constant sunshine and warm weather. Powerful meridian exchanges are possible, which could bring rapid and significant changes in the weather, including late-season cold fronts and extreme weather events such as violent storms, tornadoes, and heavy rain. The first decade of April is expected to see above-average precipitation in Italy, with the possibility of snow on the mountains. Only in the second part of the month, around Easter (April 20), is there a chance of greater atmospheric stability in Italy, although this will be updated in future articles. The spring season is expected to be extreme, with a succession of unstable and unpredictable weather patterns.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[ILMETEO.it](https://www.ilmeteo.it/notizie/meteo-aprile-sotto-la-pioggia-ecco-la-prima-tendenza-fino-a-pasqua-180002)\n\n**Possible First Summer Day of 2025: Temperatures to Reach Up to 25 Degrees Celsius**\nA meteorologist, Dominik Jung, predicts that it could be the first summer day of the year 2025 on Friday, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celsius. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), a summer day is defined as a day with a minimum air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Jung says that it will be unusually warm for the season, with temperatures in the west and southwest reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius, and locally even warmer. In the east, temperatures will reach up to 21 degrees Celsius, and in the north, up to 18 degrees Celsius. Jung also notes that the sun will shine brightly throughout the country, with 10-12 hours of sunshine per day. However, a high-pressure system called 'Konstantina' will bring Saharan dust to the country, which may cloud the sky in the west on Friday. Despite this, temperatures are expected to remain warm over the weekend, with values of 15-22 degrees Celsius predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Jung notes that it is still unclear how the weather will develop in April and May, and that cold air masses may still occur.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[T-online.de](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/wetter/id_100641434/wetter-bis-zu-25-grad-diese-woche-erster-sommertag-moeglich.html)\n\n**Unseasonable Heat Wave to Hit Leningrad Region in April**\nA synoptician has predicted that April 2025 in the Leningrad region will bring an unusual heat wave, with daytime temperatures reaching +20 degrees Celsius from the beginning of the month and potentially exceeding +25 degrees Celsius by the second half of the month. This will lead to an early awakening of nature and infrastructure in the region. While the early warmth brings pleasant prospects, it may also have negative consequences, such as early tree blooming, which can cause problems for people with allergies, and an increase in forest fires due to dry soil. However, for gardeners, this will be a welcome gift, as the long-awaited dacha season will start much earlier. For people with weather-related health issues, the rapid temperature fluctuations may pose a significant challenge. As a result, it is essential to be prepared for the unusual consequences of this early summer.

In contrast, the central and eastern regions will experience unusually high temperatures. However, this warm weather will be accompanied by the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Additionally, a high risk of wildfires is forecasted in the central and southern high plains due to strong winds, low humidity, and dry vegetation.

The National Weather Service in Miami predicts wind chills ranging from the 30s in parts of the interior and Southwest Florida to low- to mid-40s along the east coast. Patchy frost may develop across interior locations west of Lake Okeechobee Friday and Saturday mornings, with temperatures in that region reaching low- to mid-30s. Temperatures in the Miami area will see highs only reaching the mid-60s Thursday, around 60 on Friday, and 69 on Saturday. The cold weather will resume on Sunday and Monday, with highs reaching low- to mid-70s. Robert Molleda, the National Weather Service in Miami's weather coordination meteorologist, warns of a high risk of rip currents along Atlantic Beaches through the weekend and hazardous marine conditions through Saturday.

The coldest temperatures are expected late Friday night and Saturday morning, with some areas seeing temperatures in the mid-40s. Rizzuto notes that it's possible to still get strong cold fronts through the rest of the winter, particularly in January and February. 'Cloud coverage will allow for mild high temperatures, with many locations struggling to reach 70 degrees,' the NWS Miami forecast states.
