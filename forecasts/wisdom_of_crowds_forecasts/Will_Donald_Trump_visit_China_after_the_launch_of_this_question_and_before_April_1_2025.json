According to Kenneth Chang, a science reporter for The New York Times, the main reasons for this are scientific exploration, the moon's strategic location for deep space exploration, and the growing competition with China in space. A US congressman even joked that China might put up a 'no trespassing' sign in Chinese on the moon. NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the moon by 2025, but the program has faced several delays and setbacks. Despite this, NASA's administrator, Bill Nelson, remains optimistic that the US will be able to send astronauts to the moon before China does. However, with the change of government, it is unclear whether President Trump's plans for a moon return will still be pursued. Meanwhile, private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are also working on lunar missions, with SpaceX's Starship program aiming to send humans to the moon and beyond. The commercial lunar landing market is expected to grow in the coming years, with multiple companies planning to send missions to the moon in the near future.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 04:24 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8hWarH57PXN)\n\n**Trump's Strategy to Counter China: No Rush to Negotiate**\nUS President Donald Trump has been focusing on countering China since returning to the White House, and is not in a hurry to negotiate. Beijing has been holding back, hoping to 'talk conditions' with Trump. Trump's advisors point out that Trump has emphasized the need to counter China throughout his campaign, and has taken all his actions to enable the US to invest more resources in countering China. Trump's early diplomatic moves, including his efforts to end the Middle East and Ukraine wars, should be seen in this context. Trump believes that the US economy is strong and does not need to negotiate with Beijing. He is 'building many sticks and chips' that can be used in future negotiations with China. Trump has launched two rounds of tariffs against China, exposing Beijing's disadvantage in adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Chinese officials have been waiting for Trump's team to present specific demands since he first imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February. Even after Trump decided to impose another 10% tariff, China still waited for the US to bring conditions to the negotiating table. The US-China economic confrontation will inevitably lead to China facing a result it has been trying to avoid: a superpower conflict that has never occurred since the Cold War, and a comprehensive confrontation in the fields of economy, technology, and overall geopolitics. Trump won the US presidential election, and Chinese President Xi Jinping immediately asked his staff to analyze the US-Soviet conflict during the Cold War. He is worried that Trump will 'lay bare' China, isolating it like the Soviet Union during the Cold War, due to trade restrictions and sanctions cutting off its external connections. A person with contact with Chinese officials said that Xi believes it is necessary to avoid this situation. In the background of China's economic crisis, Xi has taken a defensive stance. Since Trump's re-election, China has sent multiple delegations to Washington to explore the possibility of reaching an agreement with the new US government. Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Heritage Foundation, met with members of the Chinese delegation that visited Washington after the election. He said that these delegations aimed to try to avoid the US imposing tariffs, but ultimately failed. Now that China's economy is in trouble, Trump has launched a tariff war, and 'they are desperate.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 03:38 PM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/03/06/a103964750.html)\n\n**China Warns of Global Economic Chaos, Vows to 'Fight to the End' in US Trade War**\nChina warned on Thursday that the US trade war will cause 'chaos' in the global economy, following US President Donald Trump's announcement of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. China also vowed to 'fight to the end' against the US trade war. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said in a press conference in Beijing that these measures 'undermine the stability of natural trade relations between China and the US, as well as the stability of global supply chains and industry chains, thus hindering the development of the global economy.' Wang added, 'If the US continues on this wrong path, we will fight to the end,' accusing Washington of 'acting unilaterally and arbitrarily.' Meanwhile, Chinese National Development and Reform Commission Chairman Cheng Changjie said in a press conference that China is confident in achieving its 2025 growth target despite increasing external uncertainties and domestic demand constraints. China is expected to launch major projects in key sectors such as railways, nuclear power, water conservation, and other key sectors to attract private sector investments.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/ar/%D8%A2%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7/20250306-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8)\n\n**China Promises to 'Fight to the End' in Trade War with US**\nChina has promised to 'fight to the end' if the US continues its trade war. Thousands of delegates from across China gathered in Beijing for an annual, highly orchestrated, political conclave. The authorities announced an ambitious growth target of 'around 5%' for 2025, with domestic demand as the 'driving force' of the economy. However, this goal will have to be achieved amidst an 'increasing external uncertainty', acknowledged Zheng Shanjie, president of the National Development and Reform Commission. Wang Wentao, Chinese Minister of Commerce, stated: 'If the US continues on this path, then we will fight to the end.' China is also facing internal challenges such as insufficient domestic demand, production and operational difficulties in certain sectors and companies. Despite this, Beijing is 'fully confident' in its 2025 growth target, according to Zheng Shanjie. China has officially achieved its growth target of 'around 5%' in 2024, thanks in part to a record level of exports. However, the trade war launched by the new Trump administration could deal a significant blow to this pillar of Chinese growth. To address these internal and external challenges, China has announced an increase in its budget spending. 'Public spending will continue to increase, which will greatly contribute to promoting a sustainable and healthy economic and social development,' said Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo'an. He also announced a reduction in interest rates 'in accordance with the economic and financial situation.' The growth target announced by Premier Li Qiang is in line with analyst predictions. However, many experts consider it ambitious given the scale of the economic challenges facing China.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 10:22 AM\nSource:[SudOuest.fr](https://www.sudouest.fr/international/la-chine-promet-de-se-battre-jusqu-au-bout-si-les-etats-unis-poursuivent-leur-guerre-commerciale-23526537.php)\n\n**Japan Considers Inviting Donald Trump to 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo**\nThe Japanese government is considering inviting former US President Donald Trump to the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo, according to a report by the Mainichi Shimbun on March 6. The expo, which will take place from April to October, is expected to be a major opportunity for Japan to strengthen ties with the US. Trump's visit could bring a boost to the expo, which has been criticized for lacking excitement. Japan is also planning to showcase a massive meteorite from Mars, which is expected to be a major draw for visitors. The meteorite, which is the largest of its kind ever found on Earth, is a significant discovery that provides evidence of the presence of water on Mars in the past. Trump has expressed interest in visiting Japan and has even mentioned the possibility of sending humans to Mars during his presidency. The Japanese government is hoping that Trump's visit will help to strengthen ties between the two countries and provide a boost to the expo.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:56 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250306_0003088043)\n\n**Trump's Speech to Congress: Emphasis on Domestic Issues and Trade with China**\nUS President Donald Trump delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, in which he emphasized the importance of domestic issues, including government efficiency, border security, and reducing federal spending. He also touched on international topics, such as trade with China, the Middle East, and Ukraine. Trump announced that the US will implement equal tariffs on all countries, effective April 2, 2025, and reiterated his commitment to withdrawing from the Panama Canal. He also mentioned Taiwan's investment in the US and the US's efforts to strengthen its defense industry. The speech was met with applause from Republicans, but Democrats were critical, with some walking out in protest and others holding signs that read 'Lies'.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:14 PM\nSource:[\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd](https://www.secretchina.com/news/b5/2025/03/06/1078656.html)\n\n**NASA's New Mission to Map the Universe and Trump's Reciprocal Tariff Policy**\nNASA is set to launch a new mission to map the galaxies in the universe. The mission, called 'The SPHEREx mission', aims to find over 45 billion galaxies in the universe over a period of two years. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump has announced that the US will implement a 'reciprocal tariff' policy starting from April 2. This policy involves applying the same tariff rate to imported goods as the rate imposed by the exporting country. According to the US Census Bureau, the top import countries for the US in 2024 are Mexico, China, and Canada, accounting for 42% of total imports. The top 10 import countries are: Mexico ($505.2 billion), China, Canada, Germany, Japan ($148.2 billion), Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, and India.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[goo blog](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/kyoto-hawaii/e/f817ec3ffcb56a372577943f9fe6095e)\n\n**US Launches Trade War Against Mexico, Canada, and China**\nUS President Donald Trump launched a trade war against the US' three largest trade partners, Mexico, Canada, and China, prompting immediate retaliation from the three countries and sending financial markets into a downward spiral. However, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick announced that an agreement with Mexico and Canada could be reached as early as Wednesday. 'I think [Trump] will reach an agreement with them. It won't be a pause, nothing like that, but I think he will resolve: 'You do more and we'll meet in the middle somehow', and probably we'll announce it tomorrow,' Lutnick said in an interview with Fox Business. Lutnick emphasized that 'both Mexicans and Canadians were talking to me all day on the phone, trying to show that they will do better, and the President is listening, because he is very, very fair and very reasonable.' Trump defended the imposition of tariffs on Mexico and Canada in his first address to Congress, stating that 'for decades, countries have taken advantage of the US. We're not going to let it happen anymore.' He also mentioned the need for Mexico and Canada to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, which has resulted in unprecedented numbers of US deaths. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on any products not made in the US, and announced that the US would impose reciprocal tariffs on Mexico and Canada, starting on April 2.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/guerra-comercial-2/)\n\n**Trump's Tariffs Spark Global Trade War, Threaten Economy**\nUS President Donald Trump's tariffs represent a step backward not only for the global economy but also for his own country. By imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and raising 20% tariffs on Chinese products, Trump has sparked an unnecessary trade war. According to economists, protectionist measures will increase the cost of food and industrial goods, inevitably leading to higher inflation. In response, China, Canada, and Mexico have imposed retaliatory tariffs, which will compromise global supply chains in the long run. Specialists warn that such policies threaten the stability of the international trade system, discouraging investment. Ultimately, Trump's trade strategy will penalize businesses, workers, and consumers. It's a gross error of his new administration. Trump's obsession with new tariffs will soon affect the agricultural sector. He announced on his Truth Social platform that he plans to impose tariffs on agricultural imports starting April 2, but did not specify which products or countries will be affected, leaving the market on alert. The measure will certainly have a significant impact on global trade, especially for exporting countries like Brazil. China has suspended the importation of beef from three Brazilian slaughterhouses: one unit of JBS in Mozarl\u00e2ndia (GO), another of Frisa in Nanuque (Minas Gerais), and a third of Bon Mart in Presidente Prudente (SP). According to the Brazilian Association of Exporting Meat Industries (Abiec), the embargo has no deadline. Chinese customs authorities cited 'non-conformities' in the plants visited by inspectors in Brazil. With the growth of the internet and streaming services, cable TV is facing tough times. Last year, the sector accounted for 9.3 million customers. According to the National Telecommunications Agency, this represents a 21% drop compared to 2023. To put it into perspective, a decade ago, around 20 million Brazilians accessed cable TV. Nothing suggests that the situation will change. New generations are increasingly using social media as a form of leisure. VIP lounges in airports are becoming a big business. One of the new companies in the segment, BRT Lounges, plans to invest R$ 50 million in new spaces in 2025. The company will open lounges in the BH Airport in Belo Horizonte and the Viracopos Airport in Campinas in the coming months. Apple has announced the launch of a new gadget, the iPad Air. According to the company, the model has advanced artificial intelligence features and presents a 35% performance improvement over the previous version. In Brazil, the new devices will cost between R$ 7,500 and R$ 10,000, but there is no yet availability. A consortium led by BlackRock, the world's largest manager, bought 90% of two major ports in the Panama Canal controlled by CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based company. The transaction value is US$ 23 billion. The deal was closed after pressure from the Trump government, which aims to reduce Chinese influence in the region. A survey conducted by the Brazilian Association of Human Resources found that only 29% of Brazilian employees consider their leaders prepared to face the challenges of the new times. The lack of communication skills and transparency are cited as the main deficiencies of managers. The amount of money international tourists spent in 2024 was the same as in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the World Tourism Organization.

When asked if he would visit China in 2025, Trump replied, 'If I receive an invitation, I may visit China in 2025.' This simple answer hides complex political considerations and strategic intentions. Trump has always been keen on visiting China, but his motivations are not straightforward. In his first term, he visited China and soon after sparked a trade war between the two countries. Trump's personality and behavior have always been characterized as tough, leading many to wonder if he will again use a visit as leverage for some kind of deal. Trump has a history of using negotiations to get the best deal, even if it means taking extreme measures. He launched a trade war against China in his first term and also put pressure on traditional US allies. However, the situation has changed. The 2018 trade war did not force China to surrender, but instead made the relationship between the two countries more complex. China has become a major player in the global economy, technology, and military, making any attempt to use coercion to force China to compromise unlikely to succeed. Nevertheless, Trump is a pragmatic person who understands the importance of real-world interests. Although he may use tariffs or other means to pressure China, if China shows determination and is willing to engage in multiple rounds of negotiations, Trump may change his strategy and seek more practical forms of cooperation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 12:34 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250126/47911867.html)\n\n**China Prepares to Welcome Trump for Potential Visit and Strengthen Cooperation with Washington**\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, confirmed that his country is ready to maintain communication and enhance cooperation with the US under the strategic guidance of the two leaders and based on the principles of mutual respect.

Zhao said, 'China is ready to maintain communication and enhance cooperation with the US.' Trump had previously stated that he might visit China in 2025 if he received an official invitation. Zhao added, 'China is ready, in cooperation with the new US administration, under the strategic guidance of the two leaders, and based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and mutually beneficial cooperation, to maintain communication, enhance cooperation, manage differences properly, and support further progress in China-US relations from a new starting point.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1638865-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86/)\n\n**Trump Announces New Contacts with Xi Jinping, Possible 2025 China Visit**\nUS President Donald Trump announced new contacts with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but did not specify when they will take place.

Trump arrived in Washington, D.C. on January 19, 2025, in preparation for the inauguration ceremonies and his return to power. Trump boarded a plane, 'Air Force One', sent by outgoing President Joe Biden to Florida, accompanied by his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner. After arriving at Dulles Airport in the outskirts of Virginia, Trump headed to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, near Washington. Leo Day, an Elvis Presley impersonator, sang for the new president and the first lady before a reception for around 500 guests and a fireworks display. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally with his supporters in the Capitol Hill area on Sunday evening, the eve of his inauguration, as well as a post-inauguration event on Tuesday afternoon. Due to expected icy weather on Monday, Trump has moved the inauguration ceremony from the West Front of the US Capitol Building to the Capitol Rotunda, and the parade along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Hill area. Trump will be inaugurated at 12:30 PM EST in the Capitol Rotunda, followed by his inaugural address, which typically outlines the style of his four-year presidency. Trump told CNN that the theme will be 'unity, strength, and justice.' This is the first time since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in January 1985 that the main event of the inauguration has been moved to a closed building. Most of the over 220,000 ticket holders will not be able to see the swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol Building, but will be able to watch it in the Capitol Hill area. A small portion will be able to enter the Capitol Rotunda, which can accommodate 20,000 people, and the ceremony will be broadcast.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 10:11 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/1/20/%D8%B3%D9%89-%D8%A5%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%A4%D9%83%D8%AF-%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%87-%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86/6852558)\n\n**Trump Plans to Visit China After Inauguration**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has informed his advisors of his intention to visit China within the first 100 days of his inauguration, according to The Wall Street Journal. The visit aims to deepen relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which have been strained due to Trump's threat to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports. However, a final decision has not been made, sources from the WSJ emphasized. Trump last visited Beijing in 2017, almost a year after the start of his first term. Trump's inauguration is scheduled for January 20, and Chinese Vice President Han Zheng will attend, although the new administration initially invited Xi Jinping personally. Trump and Xi spoke by phone on January 17, and their personal meeting was discussed through their representatives, according to the WSJ. One option is that Trump will invite Xi to the US, the newspaper reported. US-China relations remain tense, with Washington accusing China of spying on American politicians. China denies any involvement, including in hacking attacks. Trump announced in late November that he would impose higher tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, promising to sign the order on his first day in office. An additional 10% tariff will be imposed on Chinese products, he said, accusing Chinese authorities of inadequate action against drug trafficking. Trump has repeatedly raised this issue with Chinese officials, who have assured him of measures being taken but have not done so, he said. Another potential point of contention is Taiwan, which Beijing considers its territory and may use force to capture, the WSJ reported, citing Chinese state media. In a recent phone call, Xi reminded Trump of the need to handle the issue 'with caution', calling it a matter of national sovereignty. Disputes also surround the popular social media platform TikTok. In an interview with NBC News' 'Meet the Press' on January 18, Trump said he would 'probably' give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a ban. The US ban on TikTok, as per a court ruling, is set to take effect on January 19, a day before Trump's inauguration. The US Supreme Court had previously declined to overturn a law allowing the ban of TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner ByteDance does not sell it. In mid-December, Trump met with ByteDance CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago residence.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/wsj-donald-tramp-nameren-posetit-kitaj-v-pervye-100-dnej-posle-inauguracii/a-71342213)\n\n**Trump Plans to Visit China Soon After Taking Office, Aiming to Deepen Relations with Xi Jinping**\nDonald Trump has informed his advisors that he wants to visit China soon after taking office, aiming to deepen relations with Xi Jinping.

China is highly interested in participating in negotiations to prevent or delay the planned 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, which Trump has promised to impose. A meeting between the two leaders could help launch this process. Trump may also consider Xi as a partner in ending the war in Ukraine, given China's support for Russia. However, the conflict was not mentioned in Trump's social media post about his Friday conversation with Xi, which read, 'We will do everything possible to make the world a more peaceful and safe place!' Trump has also discussed a possible trip to India with his advisors. Initially, he plans to focus on domestic issues, including new border security measures and increased deportation. According to sources, he will embark on a US tour during his first week in office and visit Los Angeles, which was affected by fires, at the end of the week. Xi Jinping has stated that China will cooperate with the new Trump administration, which will help to resolve the differences in US-China relations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[unian.net](https://www.unian.net/world/tramp-i-si-czinpin-tramp-hochet-priehat-v-kitay-vskore-posle-inauguraciii-wsj-12888558.html)\n\n**Donald Trump wants to visit China, India soon after he takes office: Report**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has expressed his intention to visit China after taking office, aiming to strengthen ties with Beijing.

Xi said, 'We attach great importance to mutual communication and hope that the relations between China and the US will have a good start during the new term of the US President.' During his first term, Trump launched a trade war against China and imposed high tariffs on Chinese imports. He has threatened to impose even stricter measures this time, accusing China of unfair trade practices and contributing to the fentanyl crisis in the US. China has condemned the 'unjustified attacks' against it after Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, described China as 'the most powerful and dangerous adversary' before the Senate during a confirmation hearing. In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said during a press conference, 'It is necessary for the US side to have a correct understanding of China and to stop the unjustified attacks and smear campaigns against China.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 04:27 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0629](https://www.alhurra.com/arabic-and-international/2025/01/19/%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%82%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8)\n\n**Donald Trump May Visit India and China After Taking Office**\nDonald Trump, who will take the oath as the President of the United States on January 20, is considering visiting India after taking office.

However, some experts noted reports indicating Trump's interest in visiting China early in his presidency, contingent upon receiving an invitation and diplomatic engagement with Chinese leadership.
