Eligible low-income households can receive a one-time payment of $300, $400, or $500, depending on the service used, to help with heating costs. To be eligible, households must meet the following requirements: their income must be below the poverty threshold, which is $15,650 for a single person, $21,150 for two people, and $26,650 for three people, with an additional $5,550 for each additional household member. Devon Kilpatrick, manager of the energy program, said, 'Access to affordable heating is essential for the well-being of people and families, especially during the winter months.' He also stated that 'this program provides critical financial support to help households manage heating costs and maintain a safe and comfortable home environment.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/carolina-del-norte/carolina-del-norte-se-acerca-la-fecha-limite-para-pedir-ayuda-con-el-pago-de-la-tarifa-electrica-en-nid14032025/)\n\n**Ministry of Finance Issues Clean Energy Development Special Fund Management Measures**\nThe Ministry of Finance has officially issued the 'Clean Energy Development Special Fund Management Measures' on March 12, 2025, to promote the transition to clean and low-carbon energy. The measures specify that central government funds will be allocated to support the development of renewable energy, clean fossil fuels, and the utilization of fossil fuels. The fund will be implemented from 2025 to 2029. According to the measures, the fund will focus on five key areas: the demonstration and promotion of clean energy key technologies, the development and utilization of clean energy, the construction of public platforms, comprehensive application demonstrations, and other tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee. The funding will be allocated through competitive distribution, award-for-performance, and actual settlement, with a differentiated incentive policy for unconventional natural gas such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight gas. Specifically, projects that increase production by more than last year will be rewarded at a tiered rate, while those that decrease production will have their funding reduced. Additionally, projects that increase production during the heating season will receive an extra 'winter increase bonus' policy. The special fund will be used exclusively for its designated purpose and will be managed in two categories: central projects and local projects. Central enterprises with 100% state ownership can directly apply for funding, while local projects will be coordinated by provincial finance departments. The funding will be disbursed in a pre-advance and post-settlement model, requiring provinces and central enterprises to optimize funding distribution based on production efficiency and ensure that funds are used for technology upgrades, safety production, and emission reduction and efficiency improvements.

The goal is to accelerate the cleanup of contaminated sites. Other changes to the LPAmb concern tax incentives, environmental crime prosecution, and information and documentation systems. According to the new regulations, the fund for contaminated sites will support investigations and cleanups until 2032 and 2045, respectively. The fund will also support the cleanup of private playgrounds and gardens contaminated by hazardous substances. The Confederation will participate financially in the investigation and cleanup of sites near waste incineration plants or contaminated fire training centers. Environmental crime prosecution has been strengthened to combat the billion-dollar global environmental crime market. Simplifying information exchange between law enforcement and environmental authorities will make environmental crime prosecution more efficient. New information and documentation systems will simplify and accelerate data exchange between federal and cantonal authorities, applicants, and those subject to declaration obligations. The ordinances on tax incentives for 'extra-light' heating oil, gasoline, and diesel have been abolished, as they are obsolete due to stricter regulations in the anti-pollution ordinance. The provisions on noise protection will enter into force in the spring of 2026, after the anti-noise pollution ordinance is revised. All other changes to the LPAmb and the abolition of the two ordinances will take effect on April 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The Swiss Federal Gouvernment](https://www.admin.ch/gov/it/pagina-iniziale/documentazione/comunicati-stampa.msg-id-104482.html)\n\n**Government Eliminates 11 Programs from Secretariat of Childhood**\nThe government has eliminated 11 programs from the Secretariat of Childhood, as formalized through resolutions published in the Official Gazette on March 13, 2025. According to the resolutions, the elimination of these programs aims to achieve 'good management and efficient administration of resources.' The decision responds to the need to reorganize and unify regulations that involved duplication of functions and inefficient use of public resources. The goal is to avoid the overlap of initiatives and ensure a more efficient and transparent administration. However, the dissolution of these programs has raised concerns among various sectors, as many of them were focused on protecting and promoting the rights of children, adolescents, and vulnerable populations. Social organizations and child experts have expressed their worry about the potential negative impact of these measures on the affected population. The elimination of these programs reflects a shift in the government's social and cultural policies, centered on optimizing resources and restructuring initiatives.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[El Litoral](https://www.ellitoral.com/politica/gobierno-elimino-11programas-secretaria-ninez_0_MVASyRF1mI.html)\n\n**MO\u042d\u041a to Eliminate 30 Abandoned Thermal Network Sections in Moscow**\nMoscow United Energy Company (MO\u042d\u041a) plans to eliminate 30 abandoned sections of thermal networks in Moscow's above-ground laying, known as bypasses, by 2025. The project is part of a three-year program (2024-2026) implemented jointly with the Moscow Department of Housing and Utilities. 'During the work, heat supply to consumers will be switched to newly built sections of thermal networks in underground execution. In total, within the framework of the program, it is planned to inspect objects, develop and agree on design and estimate documentation, and perform work on reorganization of abandoned bypasses at more than 80 addresses,' the press service said. Most of the abandoned bypasses were not removed underground on time by organizations that previously connected their construction objects to heat supply. As a rule, these companies were liquidated and did not fulfill their obligations to the city for various reasons. MO\u042d\u041a (part of 'Gazprom Energy Holding') is the unified heat supplier of Moscow, ensuring centralized heating and hot water supply to the capital.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:45 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://realty.ria.ru/20250313/moek-2004692522.html)\n\n**Moscow to Eliminate Over 30 Abandoned Bypasses in 2025**\nMoscow's Complex of Urban Economy will eliminate over 30 abandoned bypasses in 2025, according to Deputy Mayor Petr Biryukov. The city has been working on a program to remove these bypasses since 2014, and over 200 have already been demolished. Biryukov explained that bypasses are temporary pipelines for heat and water supply, usually built for repairs or construction. However, some companies that built them failed to remove them in time, leaving them abandoned. 'These temporary structures have not been removed in a timely manner by the companies that built them, and these companies have been liquidated without fulfilling their obligations,' Biryukov said. The Moscow Energy Company will conduct the demolition in several stages, starting with project development, followed by the installation of new permanent pipelines during the off-peak season, and finally, the removal of the old bypasses. Biryukov emphasized that only abandoned bypasses will be removed, while construction bypasses will continue to be used during building or repair projects.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430](https://vm.ru/news/1213011-v-2025-godu-v-moskve-likvidiruyut-bolee-30-uchastkov-beshoznyh-bajpasov)\n\n**Jeju City Supports Low-Income Households with Energy Efficiency Improvement Project**\nThe Jeju City government is recruiting applicants for its energy efficiency improvement project, which aims to support low-income households with energy-efficient air conditioning and heating systems.
