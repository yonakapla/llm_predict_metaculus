Mr. Musk, who was born in South Africa, holds Canadian citizenship through his mother, according to Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of the businessman. Mr. Musk also holds U.S. citizenship, which he received in 2002, according to the biography.\"",

They believe that the most powerful tool used by the Trump administration to promote its annexation will be not the intelligence agencies, but rather social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk. Neil Bisson, a former CSIS officer and current director of the Global Network of Intelligence Knowledge, explained that despite the visible unity of Canada in the face of the annexation threat, there are Canadians who are particularly vulnerable to external influence, especially young people who feel economically disadvantaged. They may become the primary target of propaganda campaigns promoting American citizenship as a solution to their economic problems. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to use economic power to annex Canada, and former intelligence officials believe that the US government may use a more aggressive tactic, such as activating or funding pro-American groups in Canada, to create the impression of widespread support for this idea. Former intelligence leaders noted that US intelligence agencies rarely worked in Canada in the past, and it will take time to develop a network of agents.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 08:04 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/54339701-cbc-ssha-dlya-destabilizatsii-situatsii-v-kanade-budut-ispolzovat-resursy-maska/)\n\n**US May Use Elon Musk's Resources to Destabilize Canada, Warns Former Intelligence Officials**\nFormer high-ranking officials from the Canadian intelligence agency CSIS have warned that the US administration may use resources from Elon Musk to destabilize the situation in Canada. They believe that the most powerful tool for promoting Trump's annexation will not be intelligence agencies, but rather social media platforms like Twitter, owned by Musk. 'I would consider Mr. Musk a problem', said Ward Elcock, who led CSIS for 10 years, including during the 9/11 attacks, and served as a national security advisor. The US CIA has a history of destabilizing governments and countries using methods such as corruption and assassinations, but former intelligence leaders believe that the campaign against Canada will likely rely more on social media and less on 'cloak-and-dagger' tactics. 'Is Trump trying to change the political views in Canada? If so, that's foreign interference', said Dick Fadden, who also led CSIS and served as a national security advisor to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Neil Bisson, a former CSIS officer and current director of the Global Network of Intelligence Knowledge, explained that despite the visible unity of Canada in the face of the annexation threat, there are Canadians who are particularly vulnerable to external influence, especially young people who feel economically disadvantaged. They may become the primary target of propaganda campaigns promoting American citizenship as a solution to their economic problems. 'He clearly intends to try to destabilize our economy', said Elcock. 'The reality is that if Canada really does become impoverished, people may start to think about it. Not all Canadians will be willing to endure economic hardship. And so some may start to think about Trump's words over time.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/03/12/cbc-ssha-dlia-destabilizacii-situacii-v-kanade-budut-ispolzovat-resursy-maska.html)\n\n**Canada's privacy watchdog is investigating Elon Musk's X. Here's what you need to know**\nCanada's privacy watchdog is investigating Elon Musk's X platform to determine if it is meeting its obligations under Canada's privacy regime, PIPEDA. The investigation comes amid growing scrutiny over how tech companies use online and personal data to develop their AI models. Windsor West NDP MP Brian Masse had previously urged the privacy commissioner to review the risks of using X on government devices, warning that the platform collects user data without transparency on its use. Masse also expressed concerns over Musk's use of the platform to campaign for his preferred political candidates and potential risks to national security. Musk responded to an online petition calling for his Canadian citizenship and passport to be revoked by writing, 'Canada is not a real country.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 06:59 PM\nSource:[Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/technology/canadas-privacy-watchdog-elon-musks-x-what-need-know)\n\n**Trump's Policy of Force: A Threat to the World?**\nThe five billionaires present at President Trump's inauguration, who were never richer, have lost a total of $209 billion. This is nothing compared to their shareholders. The changes in direction and zigzags of Trump's trade war have finally unsettled the markets. The Nasdaq, the index that groups tech companies, fell by 4% on Monday, its worst performance since 2022. Tesla, Elon Musk's company, has fallen by 15%, lost more than half of its stock value, and is now worth less than before Trump's election! Trump's policies are causing concern, including the blockage of immigration along the Rio Grande, which will inevitably lead to a labor shortage in agriculture and construction. His trade tax policy is also causing problems: Trump has twice announced a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports, only to back down and delay the decision to calm the markets. Trump has also threatened on his Truth Social network to 'significantly increase' tariffs on Canadian cars starting April 2, 'if Canada does not abandon other long-standing and outrageous tariffs.' According to him, this will have the effect of 'completely stopping the Canadian automotive industry.' This policy of force is also being applied to Ukraine, where Trump is using humiliation as a policy, favoring Putin over Zelensky. As Tony Schwartz, the man who spent months with Trump to write 'The Art of the Deal,' said, 'he only cares about Donald Trump. Nothing else matters.' This judgment is rather worrying: 'once he receives the nuclear codes, he could be the one who leads to the end of civilization.' But already, seeing him duplicate Kremlin propaganda and abandon Ukraine is enough to cause concern.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[La-R%C3%A9publique-des-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es](https://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/international/l-edito-de-jean-marcel-bouguereau-l-avertissement-de-wall-street-23600318.php)\n\n**March 11, 2025: Trump & Team Highlights * WorldNetDaily * by WND Staff**\nPresident Trump has announced a 25% tariff increase on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, bringing the total tariff to 50%, in response to Ontario's 25% surcharge on electricity exports to U.S. states. Additionally, he has classified attacks on Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism, emphasizing severe prosecution for perpetrators. Tensions within the Trump administration have also risen due to Elon Musk's unilateral staff reductions in government agencies without prior consultation. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund federal agencies through September, but its prospects in the Senate remain uncertain, requiring bipartisan support to reach President Trump's desk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[WND](https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/march-11-2025-trump-team-highlights/)\n\n**Tracking Trump: Ukraine aid to resume; House passes bill to keep government open; new tariff threats; and more**\nThe U.S. is lifting its pause on military and intelligence aid to Ukraine after Ukraine endorsed a U.S. ceasefire proposal. The House has passed a bill to keep the government open through September, but it would cut over $1 billion in funds to D.C. President Trump has traded economic threats with Canada, but has since taken back a threat to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. A U.S. District Judge has ruled that Trump's suspension of USAID funds likely violated the Constitution, and Trump's administration has also paused State Department money for international exchange and study abroad programs. Health officials are seeking to tighten a loophole allowing chemicals in food, and a pro-Palestinian protester arrested by ICE faces a hearing tomorrow.

He added that this would 'essentially lead to the final closure of Canada's automotive industry.' Trump claimed that Canadian-made cars can be easily replaced by US-made cars.

The petition, presented by writer Qualia Reed, was supported by New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus, who strongly criticized Musk. Musk was born in South Africa but gained Canadian citizenship through his Regina-born mother Maye Musk. He has become one of Trump's most influential advisors and was appointed head of the Government Efficiency Department (DOGE), tasked with reducing government spending and federal workforce. Reed's petition states that Musk, as Trump's advisor, has engaged in activities contrary to Canada's national interests. It claims that Musk has become a member of a foreign government seeking to eliminate Canada's sovereignty. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose heavy tariffs on Canadian imports and has referred to Canada as the 51st US state. In response to concerns about border security and drug trafficking, Trump has agreed to delay for 30 days a plan to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports except for oil, natural gas, and electricity. The petition calls on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to revoke Musk's Canadian passport and cancel his dual citizenship status. Trudeau has announced that he will step down in the coming months, and the Canadian Parliament is currently suspended. The House of Commons is set to reconvene on March 24, but before they return, a general election call can be made. According to euronews, the petition's signature deadline is June 20, but such parliamentary petitions do not obligate the government to respond. Musk has recently criticized Trudeau on social media platform X, calling him 'irreplaceable' and supporting Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/2025/02/24/binlerce-kisi-elon-muskin-kanada-vatandasliginin-iptal-edilmesi-icin-dilekce-imzaladi)\n\n**Canadians Petition to Strip Elon Musk of Citizenship**\nMore than 150,000 Canadians have signed a parliamentary petition calling for Elon Musk to be stripped of his Canadian citizenship, citing that he 'engages in activities contrary to the national interests of the country', according to The Guardian. The petition, initiated by Canadian writer Qualeia Reid and supported by NDP MP Charlie Angus, a vocal critic of Musk, claims that Musk's involvement as an advisor to Trump undermines Canada's sovereignty. The petition urges Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to immediately revoke Musk's Canadian citizenship. Musk, born in South Africa, obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother, a native of Regina, Saskatchewan. Despite having over 167,000 signatures, the petition's fate depends on its presentation to the Canadian House of Commons. The deadline for signatures is June 20, 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 01:28 PM\nSource:[mixnews.lv](https://mixnews.lv/v-mire/2025/02/24/bolee-150-tys-kanadtsev-podpisali-petitsiyu-o-lishenii-ilona-maska-grazhdanstva/)\n\n**Petition Launched to Strip Elon Musk of Canadian Citizenship**\nA petition calling for the revocation of Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship has been launched in Canada, with over 50,000 people signing it. The petition, initiated by writer Kavalia Reid and supported by NDP MP Charlie Angus, claims that Musk's activities are 'contrary to Canada's national interests.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cited in the petition as saying that Musk's dual citizenship, obtained through his mother, should be revoked due to his birth in South Africa. The petition alleges that Musk uses his wealth and influence to impact Canadian elections and is a member of a foreign government that seeks to erode Canada's sovereignty. The petition will be presented to the House of Commons on June 20.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:28 AM\nSource:[inbusiness.kz](https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/peticiyu-s-trebovaniem-lishit-grazhdanstva-maska-zapustili-v-kanade)\n\n**Over 75,000 Canadians Petition to Revoke Elon Musk\u2019s Citizenship Over Sovereignty Concerns**\nA petition in Canada calling for the revocation of Elon Musk's citizenship has gained over 75,980 signatures as of February 23, 2025.

The expert analysis in several articles confirms that revocation of Musk's citizenship on the grounds suggested by the petition is improbable because it lacks substantial legal justification.",

However, this is speculative and not grounded in evidence of illegal activity by Musk himself. The emerging rhetoric from former intelligence officials about Musk's social media platform being leveraged for political destabilization could catalyze governmental scrutiny, but not necessarily revocation activities.",

    "summary": "The experts were tasked with forecasting the likelihood of Canada revoking Elon Musk's citizenship by April 1, 2025. Initially, experts assessed the probability to be extremely low, mostly around 0-5%, citing historical precedent, legal frameworks, and the rarity of citizenship revocation for high-profile figures without significant legal grounds. The presence of a large public petition was noted but deemed insufficient to drive legal action without substantial legal justification. In phase 2, after reviewing news articles, experts generally maintained their low probability forecasts, though some adjusted their estimates slightly upwards (by 0-5%) due to increased geopolitical tensions and allegations of Musk's potential influence on Canadian politics. However, the consensus remained that the legal and procedural barriers to revocation were significant, and without clear legal grounds, such a decision was unlikely within the given timeframe.",
