Despite retail sales falling short of expectations, the market showed resilience and rebounded. The Dow Jones was boosted by improved Chinese retail sales and reports that the Chinese government is planning to implement policies to support consumption. The Nasdaq was influenced by the keynote speech of NVIDIA's CEO at the gtc 2025 developer conference, as well as expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The market saw a surge in the final trading session, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq both closing at their highs. Sector-wise, real estate management and development, and food and household goods retail saw gains, while automobiles and automotive parts saw losses. PepsiCo rose after announcing the acquisition of functional soda brand 'Poppies'. Lululemon Athletica, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Netflix rose due to analysts' upgraded investment recommendations. Affirm fell after announcing that Swedish fintech company Klarna would replace it as the exclusive provider of its buy-now-pay-later service to Walmart. Walmart rose. Robinhood rose due to expectations of increased revenue following the launch of a new platform for predicting sports, politics, and Federal Open Market Committee results. Tesla fell due to analysts' downward revisions to their target stock price. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated in a TV interview over the weekend that there is no guarantee that the economy will avoid a recession. \nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20250318/804198.html)\n\n**Trump: Xi Jinping to Visit US in the Near Future**\nUS President Donald Trump stated that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will visit the US in the 'not too distant future'. According to Reuters. The New York stock exchange showed a positive trend after four brutal weeks, with rising stock prices for the second consecutive trading day. Traders on Wall Street chose to be optimistic and interpreted Monday's news positively. One of the factors was that US retail sales increased by 0.2% in February compared to January, which was significantly lower than some expectations of a 0.6% increase. However, excluding car sales, the increase was 0.3%, which was in line with expectations. Companies such as Walmart and IBM saw significant gains, with increases of 2.5% and 1.9% respectively. Tesla continued its downward trend, falling 4.8%. The company has fallen 40.7% since the start of the year. Factors that have contributed to the uncertainty include President Trump's confusing tariff announcement, a weakening labor market, recession warnings, decreased economic confidence among American households, rising inflation, and global security uncertainty.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 08:09 PM\nSource:[Dagens Nyheter](https://www.dn.se/direkt/2025-03-17/trump-xi-jinping-besoker-usa-inom-kort/)\n\n**Top Retail Stocks To Consider - March 17th**\nMarketBeat's stock screener tool has identified seven retail stocks to watch, including Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Group, Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, and Walmart.

Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management noted, 'The lower-than-expected CPI figure gave the markets a breath of fresh air, but the Fed is in no rush to cut rates.' Tesla is having a rough year, with its stock trading nearly 50% lower than its all-time high.

Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $108,786 on the day of Trump's inauguration, has since dropped by 25%. The decline is attributed to investors selling their positions in riskier assets, such as crypto, and moving to safer investments like government bonds. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds has fallen to 4.29%, indicating that investors are shifting their capital to less risky assets. The VIX-index, a measure of market anxiety, has risen to its highest point this year, while Walmart, a key indicator of the US economy, has warned that its expected revenue growth in 2025 will be lower than previously forecast. This has fueled anxiety and uncertainty among investors. Technology stocks, which had driven the market up in 2024, are now showing weakness, with companies like Nvidia, Palantir, and Tesla leading the decline. Meanwhile, European and Chinese markets are performing well, with the STOXX 600 index up nearly 10% this year and Chinese tech stocks rising by over 35% since January. Despite the recent corrections, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 are still higher than they were at Trump's re-election in November. However, the question remains whether the upward trend of 2023 and 2024 can be sustained in 2025, with many investors believing the market is overvalued.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 09:05 PM\nSource:[crypto-insiders.nl](https://www.crypto-insiders.nl/nieuws/bitcoin/bitcoin-en-aandelenmarkt-kelderen-sinds-trumps-rentree-hoe-komt-dit/)\n\n**Investors need to 'bring an umbrella' for rainy days ahead**\nUS stocks are trading lower at the end of a volatile week. Keith Gangl, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, advises investors to 'bring an umbrella' for potential corrections in 2025. He expects a 5-10% pullback and recommends holding onto the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, excluding Tesla, as well as healthcare and industrial sectors, and specific companies like Netflix, Dexcom, Palo Alto Networks, and Walmart. Gangl believes the market will experience a normalized return, but warns of corrections along the way.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-bring-umbrella-rainy-days-110004307.html)\n\n**Why the US Stock Market is 'Expensive' and Vulnerable**\nAaron Lanni, a portfolio manager at Medici, advises investors to look beyond the absolute price of a stock and consider the profit per share. He cites the example of Walmart, whose stock price is around $100 USD, but has a profit per share of $2.67 USD, resulting in a high multiple of 35 times earnings. In contrast, Booking's stock price is around $5000 USD, but has a profit per share of $209 USD in 2025, resulting in a multiple of 24 times earnings. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L'Heureux, a portfolio manager at Valeurs mobili\u00e8res Desjardins, notes that the US market is 'expensive' and vulnerable due to high expectations of profit growth and a list of unaccounted risks, including inflation, economic deceleration, and geopolitical tensions. He also warns that the current multiple of 22 times earnings for the S&P 500 is higher than its historical average of 16.7 times, indicating a 30% premium. 'It has reached levels higher than 22 times only twice since 1996 (during the tech bubble and the pandemic),' says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L'Heureux. 'Tesla is valued at 115 times its profits because there is a lot of enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and what it means for this company,' he adds. 'More than 80% of the value attributed to Tesla by investors is due to products that are not yet commercialized, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/marches/cher-le-marche-boursier-pourquoi-donc/2025-02-23/le-ratio-cours-benefice-comme-guide.php)\n\n**Tesla's Struggles with Electric Car Sales and Musk's Bet on AI and Robotics**\nTesla's automotive division has faced its lowest profitability in five years, with a 13.6% gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from 20-30% in 2020. The company has been actively selling cars at the end of 2024, lowering prices to get rid of excess inventory. However, investors are skeptical that this will help the company in the long term. Despite this, Tesla's stock has risen, with investors focusing on the company's development of artificial intelligence and robotics. Elon Musk has made a bet on these areas, announcing the launch of Tesla Robotaxi in June 2025 and the production of 100 million Optimus robots by 2026. Musk expects the robot market to be worth trillions of dollars, with the Optimus robot alone potentially generating more revenue than Walmart's annual income. However, some investors are concerned that Tesla is losing ground in the electric car market and facing serious problems in its core business.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/auto/2170386-tesla_profit/)\n\n",

Meanwhile, Walmart has traditionally been a more stable company with a large consumer base and less volatility in its market cap values.

Over the past five years, there have been several quarters where Tesla's market cap exceeded Walmart's, but not consistently. This provides an initial rough base rate of 50% for either company having a higher market cap at any specific point in time.",
